Getty 2/17 Batsman: Alastair Cook The former captain will be crucial to England's hopes, with the Essex opener needing to find the same resilient form that he displayed in Australia in the 2010/11 series. Getty 3/17 Batsman: Mark Stoneman Cook's likely opening partner will be Mark Stoneman after selectors decided to stick with him despite a nervous series against the West Indies. Getty 4/17 Batsman/spinner: Dawid Malan Malan showed glimpses of promise this summer and can also offer an option with the ball, but he is untested on the hard pitches of Australia and could be found out. Getty 5/17 Batsman: Gary Ballance Ballance is handed yet another chance to salvage his England career as the selectors hope he will eventually come good for their unyielding faith.

       " 'The 1945 Sinkings of the Cap Arcona and the Thielbek\\n\\nAllied Attacks Killed Thousands of Concentration Camp Inmates\\n\\nBy Mark Weber\\n\\nAll prisoners of German wartime concentration camps who perished while in German custody are routinely regarded as \"victims of Nazism\" -- even if they lost their lives as direct or indirect result of Allied policy. Similarly, all Jews who died in German captivity during World War II -- no matter what the cause of death -- are counted as \"victims of the Holocaust.\"\\n\\nThis view is very misleading, if not deceitful. In fact, many tens of thousands of camp inmates and Jews lost their lives as direct and indirect victims of Allied action, or of the horrors of the Second World War. For example, the many thousands of Jews who perished in the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp during and after the final months of the war in Europe, including Anne Frank, were primarily victims not of German policy, but rather of the turmoil and chaos of war.\\n\\nAmong the German concentration camp prisoners who perished at Allied hands were some 7,000 inmates who were killed during the war\\'s final week as they were being evacuated in three large German ships that were attacked by British war planes. This little-known tragedy is one of history\\'s greatest maritime disasters.\\n\\nThe Cap Arcona, launched in May 1927, was a handsome passenger ship of the \"Hamburg-South America\" line. At 27,000 gross registered tons, it was the fourth-largest ship in the German merchant marine. For twelve years -- until the outbreak of war in 1939 -- she had sailed regularly between Hamburg and Rio de Janeiro. In the war\\'s final months she was pressed into service by the German navy to rescue refugees fleeing from areas in the east threatened by the Red Army. This was part of a vast rescue operation organized by the German navy under the supervision of Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz. All but unknown in the United States today, this great undertaking saved countless lives. The Thielbek, a much smaller ship of 2,800 gross registered tons, was also used to transport refugees as part of the rescue operation.\\n\\nIn April 1945, Karl Kaufmann, Gauleiter of Hamburg and Reich Commissioner for merchant shipping, transferred the Cap Arcona and the Thielbek from naval command, and ordered them to Neustadt Bay in the Baltic Sea near the north German city of Lübeck.\\n\\nSome 5,000 prisoners hastily evacuated from the Neuengamme concentration camp (a few miles southeast of Hamburg) were brought on board the Cap Arcona between April 18 and 26, along with some 400 SS guards, a naval gunnery detail of 500, and a crew of 76. Similarly the Thielbek took on some 2,800 Neuengamme prisoners. Under the terrible conditions that prevailed in what remained of unoccupied Germany during those final weeks, conditions for the prisoners on board the two vessels were dreadful. Many of the tightly packed inmates were ill, and both food and water were in very short supply.\\n\\nOn the afternoon of May 3, 1945, British \"Typhoon\" fighter-bombers, striking in several attack waves, bombarded and fired on the Cap Arcona and then the Thielbek. The two ships, which had no military function or mission, were flying many large white flags. \"The hoisting of white flags proved useless,\" notes the Encyclopedia of the Third Reich. The attacks were thus violations of international law, for which -- if Britain and not Germany had been the vanquished power -- British pilots and their commanders could have been punished and even executed as \"war criminals.\"\\n\\nThe Thielbek, struck by rockets, bombs and machine gun fire, sank in just 15-20 minutes. British planes then fired on terror-stricken survivors who were struggling in rescue boats or thrashing in the cold sea. Nearly everyone on board the Thielbek perished quickly, including nearly all the SS guards, ship\\'s officers and crew members. Only about 50 of the prisoners survived.\\n\\nThe burning Cap Arcona took longer to go under. Many inmates burned to death. Most of those who were able to leap overboard drowned in the cold sea, and only some 350-500 could be rescued. During the next several days hundreds of corpses washed up on nearby shores, and were buried in mass graves. Having sunk in shallow water, the wreck of the capsized Cap Arcona remained partially above water as a grim reminder of the catastrophe.\\n\\nA German reference work, Verheimlichte Dokumente, sums up:\\n\\nA particularly barbaric Allied war crime was the bombing on May 3, 1945, by British Royal Air Force planes of the passenger ships Cap Arcona and Thielbek in the Lübeck bay, packed with concentration camp inmates. Among the many \\'nameless\\' victims were many prominent political figures, a fact that is hushed up today because the fact that concentration camp inmates, many of them',\n",

The Palace of Westminster… February 6, 2013\\n\\nCommonly thought to be older than it actually is due to its Gothic stylings (although, to be fair, parts of it do date from medieval times), the Palace of Westminster – or, as it's more commonly known, the Houses of Parliament – didn't actually take on much of its current appearance until the latter half of the 19th century.\\n\\nThe need for a new building for parliament arose after 1834 when a fire, caused by the overheating of two underfloor stoves used to incinerate the Exchequer's obsolete tally sticks, tore through the former complex, leaving only some structures from the old palace intact. They included the 11th century Westminster Hall (the largest in Europe when it was built), 14th century Jewel Tower and a chapterhouse, crypt and cloisters, all of which was once attached to the now gone St Stephen's Chapel.\\n\\nWhile King William IV offered the use of Buckingham Palace for Parliament, the idea – along with a host of other options – was rejected as unsuitable. Instead, a competition was held for a new design and after almost 100 entries were considered, architect Charles Barry and his design for a new palace in the perpendicular Gothic style was chosen. Interestingly, while Barry was a classical architect, under the terms of the competition, designs were required to be in a Gothic style, thought to embody conservative values .\\n\\nIncorporating some of the remains of the old palace – including Westminster Hall but not the Jewel Tower which to this day stands alone – the design was based around a series of internal courtyards with the House of Commons and House of Lords located on either side of a central lobby (first known as Octagonal Hall). The design involved reclaiming some land from the Thames so the building's main river-facing facade could be completed.\\n\\nTowers stand at either end of the complex – the Victoria Tower over the Sovereign's Entrance at the southern end of the complex (for many years the tallest square stone tower in the world) and the narrower tower formerly known as the Clock Tower which houses the bell Big Ben, at the northern end – and there is a central Octagonal Tower which stands directly over the Central Lobby. The Clock Tower, incidentally, was renamed the Elizabeth Tower last year in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee (for more on it and Big Ben, see our earlier entries here and here).\\n\\nOther towers include the Speaker's Tower (located at the northern end of the building on the waterfront, this contains a residence for the Speaker), the Chancellor's Tower (located at the southern end, it too contained a residence originally used by the Lord Chancellor) and St Stephen's Tower – located in the middle of the building's west front, it contains the public entrance to the building. Significant other rooms in the palace complex include the Robing Room – where the Queen puts on her ceremonial robes and crown before the State Opening of Parliament – and the Royal Gallery, used for state occasions.\\n\\nThe foundation stone (the building was constructed out of sand-coloured limestone from Yorkshire) was laid in 1840 and construction of the monumental building – which features more than 1,100 rooms and two miles of passageways – wasn't completely finished until the 1870s although most of the work had been completed by 1860 (the year Barry died). The House of Lords first sat in their new chamber in 1847 and the House of Commons in 1852 (it was at this point that Barry was knighted for his work).\\n\\nThe cost, meanwhile, originally estimated at less than £750,000, ended up coming in at more than £2 million.\\n\\nMuch of the interior decoration owes its appearance to the Gothic revivalist Augustus Pugin who designed everything from wallpapers, to floor tiles and furnishings. Pugin also helped Barry with the external appearance but like Barry died before the project was completely finished (in 1852).\\n\\nThe palace was bombed numerous times in World War II – in one raid, the Commons Chamber was destroyed as firefighters opted to save the much older Westminster Hall instead. It was later rebuilt under the direction of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and completed by 1950. Other aspects of the building have also been restored.\\n\\nA Grade I-listed building classified as a World Heritage Site, Barry's Houses of Parliament remain one of London's most iconic structures. We'll be looking in more detail at some of the building's features in future posts.\\n\\nWHERE: Houses of Parliament (nearest Tube stations are Westminster, St James's Park and Embankment); WHEN: Tours (75 minutes) are run from 9.15am to 4.30pm on Saturdays (also six days a week during summer opening); COST: £15 adults/£10 concessions/£6 children five to 15 years (children under five are free).

       " ': This week the Chilean government\\'s promise to protect roughly 10 million acres of land became official, boosting the nation\\'s parklands by 38.5 percent, according to a statement . Read our original story about the move below:\\n\\nLast week, the government of Chile signed an agreement taking possession of a 1-million-acres of private park land put together by a pair of American philanthropists. It also announced it would protect an additional 9 million acres of wildlands as national parks, reports Jonathan Franklin at The Guardian.\\n\\nKris McDivitt Tompkins, former CEO of the clothing company Patagonia and her husband, Doug Tompkins, co-founder of the North Face and Esprit clothing lines, began buying hundreds of thousands of acres in the wild Patagonia region of Chile in the early 1990s, The Guardian\\'s John Vidal reported last year. Their goal, Vidal writes, was to \"buy and restore as much land as they could, improve and protect it, and then return it to people as public, national parks.\"\\n\\nAfter over two decades of work, they acquired 2.2 million acres of land, including the gifted land, Parque Pumalín and Patagonia, which together span roughly 1 million acres and represent the largest land donation from a private entity to a country.\\n\\nBut Chile was not always receptive to the couple. In the beginning of the project, they were accused of being CIA spies, of trying to hobble Chile\\'s economic development and called a national security threat. At one point the government threatened to take their land.\\n\\n\"We were opposed for four years. We were \\'the couple who cut Chile in half,\\'\" McDivitt Tompkins tells Vidal. \"They said we were setting up a nuclear-waste dump or a new Jewish state.\"\\n\\nBut in recent years, the Chilean government has warmed up to the conservation projects, and president Michelle Bachelet was on hand at the border of Pumalin Park to sign the documents authorizing the handover. As Elizabeth Royte at National Geographic reports, Chile hopes to include the new parks in a 1,500-mile tourism route they want to call the Ruta de los Parques, which would link together 17 national parks and offer everything from rainforest hikes and mountaineering to sea kayaking. By some estimates the new parks will bring $270 million into the area and employ 43,000 people.\\n\\nThe new parks make Chile one of Central and South America\\'s most eco-conscious nations. \"That puts Chile right up there with Costa Rica in terms of the percentage of protected lands,\" Yvon Chouinard, founder of the Patagonia clothing company tells Franklin. \"No other human has ever created this many acres of protected wildlands…These are tourist-ready parks with trails and cabins and infrastructure.\"\\n\\nHowever, Doug Tompkins, who died in 2015 in a kayaking accident, will never see the fruits of their labor. \"I wish my husband Doug, whose vision inspired today\\'s historic pledge, were here on this memorable day. Our team and I feel his absence deeply,\" McDivitt Tompkins says in a press release. \"But I know that if Doug were here today, he would speak of national parks being one of the greatest expressions of democracy that a country can realize, preserving the masterpieces of a nation for all of its citizenry.\"\\n\\nThe handover of the Tompkins property will take place incrementally over the next two years.',\n",
       " \"Household fast food names could soon be a thing of the past thanks to the funding of plant-based alternatives from some of the world's biggest investors. The plant-based food scene is changing rapidly, no longer are vegans thought to eat nothing but lettuce and lentils, the plant-based burger revolution has arrived. What's more, big investors are excited about it.\\n\\nRecently, Beyond Meat's burger, otherwise known as 'the burger that bleeds' accomplished something huge when they struck a deal with stores owned by Kroger, that means their burger will be stocked in 605 stores across the US. Beyond have seen investments from some big names including Bill Gates, General Mills and even meat producers Tyson Foods. Tyson's CEO said earlier this year that the future of protein may lie in the meatless market.\\n\\nA similar burger, made by Impossible Foods, who Bill Gates has also invested in, managed to accumulate $75 million worth of funding last month. Alongside Bill Gates, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Asia's second richest man Li Ka-shing were amongst the contributors.\\n\\nImpossible are currently waiting on confirmation from the FDA about their ingredient 'heme', which they were granted a patent for this month. Heme is the key to their 'meat like' burgers and is derived from soy. As yet the FDA are undecided as to whether this product will be considered an allergen, which is currently stopping Impossible from distributing further. However, it seems that they will have a lot of support behind them when they do.\\n\\nTaking it one step further, from individual products to a whole chain of restaurants, By Chloe has taken the US by storm since its first store opened its doors in 2015. The fully plant-based chain which has been described as 'Shake Shack without the meat', is already venturing across the Atlantic to London, where it will open its first European store in Covent Garden later this year. Since opening, the chain has sold over 600,000 vegan burgers, which aren't the only item on their menu. These high figures may account for the whopping $13 million dollars invested in the chain recently to allow them to expand both in the US and overseas.\\n\\nStart-ups like these are seeing an increase in popularity, and it's not surprising. Plant-based foods are much more sustainable than their animal product alternative, something Impossible Foods boast about on their site. The increased number of options allow people who are still keen on the taste of meat, as well as those who want to celebrate vegetables, plenty of things to try without comprising their favourite foods.\\n\\nWith backing from big investors these companies could go from just starting out to fast food giants pretty quickly, and with everything they have to brag about it could mean a sharp decline in some of the world's biggest fast food outlets.\\n\\nUnless, of course, McDonalds want to jump on the plant-based bandwagon?\\n\\nImage credit: Impossible Foods | Beyond Meat | Grub Street | by Chloe\",\n",
       " 'by David E. Petzal - Thursday, June 29, 2017\\n\\nAccording to a poll by the Media Insight Project, only 6 percent of Americans have faith in the news media. Among readers of American Rifleman, that figure is likely even lower. We\\'ve learned that, in all probability, anything we read or hear about guns will be either biased or factually wrong, or both. How come?\\n\\nReason One:\\n\\nLack of accountability. When I broke into the magazine business in 1964, I had some basic rules drummed into my crew-cut head. If you edited a piece, you were responsible for everything in it: spelling, punctuation, facts, everything—especially facts.\\n\\nIf you were wrong, God help you. The least you would get was a serious public tongue-lashing. As a result of this process I can tell you to this day that it\\'s the Smithsonian Institution, not Institute, and that \"prairie\" is not spelled \"prarie.\" A cousin of mine, who worked at one of the big New York City daily newspapers, had exactly the same experience.\\n\\nThis seems to have gone by the wayside. A small example: On Jan. 5, in The New York Times, there was an article on \"ballistics vests.\" What\\'s wrong with this? It\\'s \"ballistic vests.\" \"Ballistics\" is the science of projectile behavior and is a noun, while \"ballistic\" means relating to ballistics, and is an adjective. No one at The Times appears to know the difference. If I had made that mistake, or my cousin had, we would have been screamed at for 10 minutes with no regard for our \"safe space.\"\\n\\nReason Two:\\n\\nPeople in the same profession tend to think alike. Among the news media, the collective wisdom regarding guns runs as follows:\\n\\n1. They believe guns are inherently evil.\\n\\n2. They think gun owners are, at the least, disturbed and, at the worst, dangerous.\\n\\n3. They believe the National Rifle Association has, since its founding in 1871, done nothing worthwhile, has never been right about anything and is nothing more than a shill for the firearm industry.\\n\\n4. They believe the Second Amendment has no relevance in today\\'s United States, and if only we could institute reasonable gun controls there would be no more gun violence.\\n\\n5. It is their opinion that guns in the home lead only to tragedy, and self-protection is a myth.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s assume that you\\'re a student in journalism school, and the subject of guns comes up, and you venture the fact that you own guns, and use them, and that your family has always had guns in the home, and that there\\'s never been an accident, and that you don\\'t even know of any accidents. How do you think that statement would be received?\\n\\nMost likely, you would shortly receive a summons from the dean of students and probably the college psychiatrist to come in and chat, not that there\\'s anything wrong, you understand, but … .\\n\\nOr let\\'s say that you work in a newsroom and the subject of guns used in self-defense comes up and you point out that, every month, you can cite half a dozen or more cases in \"The Armed Citizen\" where someone who had a gun prevented a crime or saved themselves or someone else and, in many instances, did it without firing a shot. Imagine the look you\\'re going to get from the news director. It will not be the kind of look that says your career will prosper here.\\n\\nReason Three:\\n\\nGood old-fashioned ignorance. I got my first exposure to this in the mid-1960s when the armed forces began issuing M16s. The 5.56 mm bullets, we were told by reporters, created terrible wounds because \"they tumbled through the air and hit people like little buzz saws.\"\\n\\n\"Golly gee,\" I said, (or words to that effect), \"that\\'s just not possible. Anything that tumbles through the air isn\\'t going to go where it\\'s aimed. Just look at a football that doesn\\'t spiral.\"\\n\\nBut there it was, and there was more to come.\\n\\nWhen the first Glocks were imported they were denounced as \"all plastic,\" and therefore undetectable at airports. The media, knowing nothing of how guns work, and not understanding such concepts as mass and resistance, printed the nonsense verbatim.\\n\\nWhen the great \"cop-killer-bullet\" brouhaha erupted, the media also neglected to check the facts. If they had, they would have learned that Teflon-coated ammunition was very expensive, made in limited amounts, sold to police agencies only and had never been used to kill a cop.\\n\\nJournalists are ignorant about guns because being knowledgeable about guns requires at least a smattering of',\n",

       " 'Getty Images\\n\\nEagles quarterback Michael Vick has heard people, including the President of the United States, call for him to slide feet first dozens of times in the last few years.\\n\\nIf Vick played for the Vikings, he might not hear quite as much criticism of the way he ends his runs. Vikings offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave wants quarterback Christian Ponder to slide head first after he suffered a concussion on a hit by Redskins linebacker London Fletcher after a feet first slide last season. Musgrave is fine with sliding feet first when there\\'s no one around, but he thinks Ponder gets to the ground more quickly if he leads with his head in traffic.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t want to expose ourselves by being a periscope up — exposing all our vital organs.

       " 'What the team was looking for, in particular, were elements like thorium and uranium, which along with potassium, warm Earth\\'s interior. This heat affects its plate tectonics and, according to the scientists, the way it retains its water. Though the functions of that heat-to-plate-to-liquid interaction aren\\'t fully understood -- it\\'s \"one of the great mysteries in the geosciences,\" the study\\'s advisor, Wendy Panero, put it -- scientists have speculated that the forces of heat convection in the mantle, the ones that move Earth\\'s crust, have some kind of role in regulating the amount of water in the oceans. \"It seems that if a planet is to retain an ocean over geologic timescales, it needs some kind of crust \\'recycling system,\\' and for us that\\'s mantle convection,\" Unterborn said.\\n\\nWhich means, in turn, that plate tectonics could also be a key indicator of a planet\\'s hospitality to life. Particularly for microbial life -- since microbial life on Earth, the study\\'s authors point out, benefits from subsurface heat. (Take the single-celled microbe archaea, some of which live not off the energy of the sun, but rather off the heat rising from inside the Earth.) And that indicator, the team reasoned, can be approximated by analyzing a given exoplanet\\'s sun: the more thorium in the star, say, the more likely a terrestrial planet formed around that star would be to support life. Since it would stand to reason that the planets that orbit around those suns contain more thorium, as well, that would suggest that the interiors of those exoplanets are warmer than ours -- and also that those planets are more geologically active than Earth. And that would mean that they are more likely than Earth to retain the liquid water that supports life.\\n\\nAnd: Of the eight solar twins the team studied, seven of them seemed to contain more thorium than our own star.\\n\\nOne star in the team\\'s survey, for example, contained 2.5 times more thorium than our sun. And per the study\\'s measurements, terrestrial planets that formed around that star likely generate 25 percent more internal heat than Earth does -- with all that that implies. So there could be at least one planet that is potentially more life-affirming than Earth. But there could also be, the study suggests, more where that came from: exoplanets that are more earthly than Earth -- planets nourished and made hospitable by the warmth of other suns.\\n\\nNow that the hunt for exoplanets has moved from science fiction to science, that finding -- preliminary and tentative as it is -- could have implications for humans\\' ability to find signs of life elsewhere in the universe. As study co-author Cayman Unterborn summed it up: \"If it turns out that these planets are warmer than we previously thought, then we can effectively increase the size of the habitable zone around these stars by pushing the habitable zone farther from the host star, and consider more of those planets hospitable to microbial life.\"',\n",

It is now the premier Web site for human trafficking in the United States, according to the National Association of Attorneys General. And it\\'s not a fly-by-night operation. Backpage is owned by Village Voice Media, which also owns the estimable Village Voice newspaper.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nAttorneys general from 48 states have written a joint letter to Village Voice Media, pleading with it to get out of the flesh trade. An online petition at Change.org has gathered 94,000 signatures asking Village Voice Media to stop taking prostitution advertising. Instead, the company has used The Village Voice to mock its critics. Alissa thought about using her real name for this article but decided not to for fear that Village Voice would retaliate.\\n\\nCourt records and public officials back Alissa\\'s account, and there is plenty of evidence that under-age girls are marketed on Backpage. Arrests in such cases have been reported in at least 22 states.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nJust this month, prosecutors in New York City filed charges in a case involving a gang that allegedly locked a 15-year-old Long Island girl in an empty house, drugged her, tied her up, raped her, and advertised her on Backpage. After a week of being sold for sex, prosecutors in Queens said, the girl escaped.\\n\\nLiz McDougall, general counsel of Village Voice Media, told me that it is \"shortsighted, ill-informed and counterproductive\" to focus on Backpage when many other Web sites are also involved, particularly because Backpage tries to screen out ads for minors and reports possible trafficking cases to the authorities. McDougall denied that Backpage dominates the field and said that the Long Island girl was marketed on 13 other Web sites as well. But if street pimps go to jail for profiteering on under-age girls, should their media partners like Village Voice Media really get a pass?\\n\\nParadoxically, Village Voice began as an alternative newspaper to speak truth to power. It publishes some superb journalism. So it\\'s sad to see it accept business from pimps in the greediest and most depraved kind of exploitation.\\n\\nTrue, many prostitution ads on Backpage are placed by adult women acting on their own without coercion; they\\'re not my concern. Other ads are placed by pimps: the Brooklyn district attorney\\'s office says that the great majority of the sex trafficking cases it prosecutes involve girls marketed on Backpage.\\n\\nVideo\\n\\nAlissa, who grew up in a troubled household in Boston, has a story that is fairly typical. She says that one night when she was 16 — and this matches the account she gave federal prosecutors — a young man approached her and told her she was attractive. She thought that he was a rapper, and she was flattered. He told her that he wanted her to be his girlfriend, she recalls wistfully.\\n\\nWithin a few weeks, he was prostituting her — even as she continued to study as a high school sophomore. Alissa didn\\'t run away partly because of a feeling that there was a romantic bond, partly because of Stockholm syndrome, and partly because of raw fear. She says violence was common if she tried connecting to the outside world or if she didn\\'t meet her daily quota for cash.\\n\\n\"He would get aggressive and strangle me and physically assault me and threaten to sell me to someone that was more violent than him, which he eventually did,\" Alissa recalled.

The charges carry a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. An agreed statement of facts tendered to the court details graphic communications which \"amount to child pornography\" that were exchanged between the men on Skype. The conversations include descriptions of what the pair would like to do to children, their preferences of children as young as three including ages and physical features, and discussion of where to access videos and photos of child pornography. On May 12, 2015, McCormack - who used the screen name \"oz4skinboi\" and claimed to be 28 - said he couldn\\'t wait to look at \"B porn\".

       " 'On June 17 at about 13:40 I crossed the Ambassador bridge into Windsor Ontario Canada. I intended to see Rush\\'s 2 Toronto concerts and a Blue Jays game.\\n\\nAt customs an agent Reid was intensely interested in my electronics, in particular she was obsessed with an old VHS VCR that was in a suitcase in my trunk along with a dozen or so VHS tapes. Every bit of media, Digital and analog was taken out of my vehicle and scrutinized. Even the \"timer\" VCR tapes with CSI Reruns and Oprah recorded on them. After logging in to my Twitter account, and finding a \"Tweet\" on my laptop to the username <Girls Name Redacted> Officer Reid accused me of lying to her about knowing \"<Girls Name Redacted> (I don\\'t know her, the messages that Reid read clearly illustrated that) and demanded the password for my cell phone. At this point I asked to speak to a supervisor. This was when I spoke to Mr Mailoux, who told me that if I did not provide the password, my phone would be seized and sent to Ottawa for evaluation. He said that MacDonald believed that I was meeting a \"girl of questionable age\" and that all of my digital and analog media was suspect. I provided the password, there was nothing illegal on my phone, my iPod, my (now broken) tablet, my laptop, or any of the 20 or so VHS tapes that were meticulously scrutinized, and two cameras and their SD cards, which I cannot locate at the moment as my personal belongs were COMPLETELY RANSACKED and scattered inside of my vehicle! <Girls Name Redacted> gave her age as 21 on Twitter, and I had no reason to doubt her, we had only kicked around the idea of possibly meeting, and she warned me that her \"social anxiety\" might keep her home. So when Ms Reid asked if I knew anyone, or if I was meeting someone, my 100% honest answer was and still is \"NO\" Since Reid had obviously read the same messages, she knew all of this before asking, and my answers confirmed exactly what the messages said, regardless, she accused me of lying. About 45min later I was told that a \"weapon\" had been found in my car and that it had been seized, I could only get my car back if I paid $500.\\n\\nWhen I asked for the documents, Mr. MacDonald said that he already gave them to me. I knew this was not the case, the only place I could put the documents was in the car that was not in my possession. I was wearing swim-trunks, sandals and a pocketless T-Shirt, the documents were NOT in my possession! Only after asking for a supervisor did he provide me with \"copies\" of the forms.\\n\\nThe \"weapon\" in question is some sort of tool, although I cannot tell you what kind. It was in a box of tools that I borrowed to repair the door handle on my car, and it got left behind after the chore was finished. I never used it, just removed it to get to another tool, and did not return it to the box of loaner tools.\\n\\nThe replacement handles were also in the car at the time, and so was the broken one that had been replaced. The tool was in the door handle pocket with a pinball and a pack of matches, all just miscellaneous odds and ends that I found under the seats last time I vacuumed the car. It was a random piece of \"junk\" that wound up being put in the door handle. The item is NOT BRASS KNUCKLES, it is not brass, and there are only 2 rings on it, and they pivot from side to side I do not know what it is, I do know that it is NOT a WEAPON, and that I have never used it as a either a tool or a weapon.\\n\\nWhen I asked Mr Mailloux (the \"supervisor\") for his name, he said \"I will get you a card\" and he did, although the card had no name on it. His name was clearly on his uniform, so while there was no attempt to \"hide\" his identity, the card \\'trick\\' seemed like he was trying to \"pull something\". Clearly there is distrust on both sides at this point.\\n\\nSince a don\\'t know what the tool even is and it would be expensive to ship due to it\\'s weight, I would simply like to appeal the $500 that was demanded to return my vehicle. What ever the tool is, as I do not know what it is, I have no use for it. What I DO have a use for is the $500 that I was forced to pay for the return of my vehicle.\\n\\nMy arrest in 1988 was disclosed to Reid, it was 25+ years old and was dismissed. This has not been an issue my previous 3 visits to Canada.\\n\\nSo ummmm any ideas',\n",

Manuel as starters, neither made it to the finish with undrafted rookie Jeff Tuel and estranged starter Brandon Weeden filling in after injuries. Stevie Johnson also left the game early and C.J.

However, his 8 carries were enough to flash his still-blazing speed on route to a 54 yard rushing TD.\\n\\nWhile Weeden was booed by his home crowd initially, he was able to put some scoring drives together fueled by the ultra-talented Josh Gordon and electric return-man Travis Benjamin, who had 179 punt-return yards and a TD.\\n\\nEveryone had pinned the Browns as tossing the season after dismissing Trent Richardson for a 1st round pick. However, his weak 3.1 YPC this season reveals more of his NFL ability than his college success and 3rd-overall draft status. With a potentially top-loaded draft in 2014, the Browns are looking sneakily clever. Now, with the Ravens struggling and the Bengals inconsistent, the Browns are in control of their division. With their next 3 games against the Lions, Packers and Chiefs, their tough defense will be severely tested as they try to hold onto a division they've never won.\",\n",
       " 'Pro-abortion protesters outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., in March. (Reuters photo: Kevin Lamarque)\\n\\nA strange controversy in Texas\\n\\nTexas has passed a regulation requiring that human corpses be disposed of in accordance with the state\\'s regulation for the disposal of human corpses. That this exercise in tautology was necessary — and that it is controversial — is a reminder that we live in the golden age of mass delusion.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe underlying question here, which properly understood isn\\'t a question at all, has to do with abortion, and what it is that an abortion does. The biological answer to that question is straightforward: An abortion is a procedure in which a physician or another party kills a living human organism, either prior to birth or in the course of inducing a birth. About the three relevant criteria — 1) living, 2) human, 3) organism — there is no serious question: The tissue is living tissue, not dead tissue; it is human tissue, not rutabaga or koala bear tissue; it is arranged into an individual organism rather than an organ or a tumor or an extension of the maternal body.\\n\\nBecause the biology is straightforward, maintaining the fiction that abortion is something other than the premeditated killing of a living human being requires a retreat into poorly wrought metaphysics. The same people who will lecture you about science eight days a week inexplicably embrace pre-modern superstitious notions of \"ensoulment\" and work up some fine angels-dancing-on-the-head-of-a-pin material about \"personhood,\" the legal construction one uses when one is trying one\\'s best not to notice that what happens in an abortion is killing and that what is killed is a distinct and individual human being.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe abortion ethic is based on a lie: that the procedure involves nothing more than the elimination of a meaningless clump of cells. That lie is bound up in a nest of lies of which it is one particularly poisonous constituent, all of which are aimed at denying the relationship between sex and procreation or at denying the deep and wide-ranging consequences of attempting to disrupt that relationship. And that larger tangle of lies is itself only a constituent of an even more sprawling mess of confusion and deceit holding that men and women are interchangeable social units, that motherhood and fatherhood are social fictions that were dreamt up rather than evolved, and that you, Sunshine, and your desires are the very center of this universe.\\n\\nThe dead baby in the surgical tray makes all that nonsense rather hard to sustain.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTexas governor Greg Abbott approved a proposal yesterday that would forbid treating the bodies of the dead like used bandages or other medical waste, instead requiring that they be cremated or buried. The burials, if they come to pass, will be surreal affairs. What would one say? Would the mother attend?\\n\\nThe rule does not apply to miscarriages or to \"abortions that take place at home,\" presumably a reference to pharmaceutically induced abortions.\\n\\nYes, the Texas rule is transparent: It is a transparent attempt to force Texans to face reality.\\n\\nThe abortion lobby is apoplectic, which is what it always is, which must get exhausting. NARAL Pro-Choice Texas protests that the move is a \"transparent\" attempt to burden abortionists. \"The rules target physicians that provide abortions and the hospitals that care for patients,\" says Blake Rocap, the lawyer for the group. \"Transparent\" is a funny choice of word: NARAL is an organization that refuses even to say its own name — it is formerly the National Abortion Rights Action League — or to acknowledge what sort of \"choice\" it is advocating.\\n\\nYes, the Texas rule is transparent: It is a transparent attempt to force Texans to face reality.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt probably will not prevent (at least not directly) a single abortion from taking place, and, though the particulars of their condition is unknowable, it seems unlikely that a grave or a dignified cremation will make the victims feel any better about having had their lives snuffed out before they had had a chance to take a breath, much less to take a step or fall in love. The dead, Private Joker informs us, know only one thing: that it is better to be alive — though Christians, who in one month will celebrate the Feast of the Holy Innocents, take a different view. Whichever story is closer to the truth, death is death is death.\\n\\nBut our children are not garbage. Not the living ones, and not the dead, as resolute as their parents may be in treating them as though they were. Reality will not be denied. Not for very long. Not in Texas. Not anywhere.',\n",

(WBRE/WYOU Staff Photo)\\n\\nWILKES BARRE, LUZERNE COUNTY (WBRE/WYOU) - Luzerne County elections officials were scrambling Tuesday after receiving a barrage of complaints about the county\\'s electronic voting machine turning Republican votes for Donald Trump to votes for Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nEyewitness News was the first to report the problem early Tuesday morning after more than a score of voters contacted us saying that when they checked the straight-party Republican ticket option on their voting machine all the GOP candidates were checked - except Trump. Instead, Hillary Clinton\\'s name appeared as their selection.\\n\\n\"If you click on Republican,\" says \"Becky\", a Dallas voter. \"Hillary was automatically picked and moved to the next screen. I went back to change it and it wouldn\\'t let me. I had to have someone come over and reset my scree. She said that it happened to someone earlier.\"\\n\\n\"I now believe that this is rigged!\", she wrote Eyewitness News.\\n\\n\"My concern is I was smart enough to realize that after making three separate attempts to try to complete my ballot,\" says Lorraine of Pittston Township \"the machine was trying to cast it for me. I stopped and called for help.\"\\n\\nElection officials initially told us that they had received no word of the problem, then conceded about an hour later there was a problem.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve gotten several calls,\" Luzerne County Election Bureau Solicitor Mike Butera told us just before 11:00 a.m.. Initially, they said the problems appeared to be related to \"voter error\" \"We sent technicians to every polling place where we received a complaint. We found no vote flipping at all. We have found some machine glitches, which were fixed.\"\\n\\nWhile the problem seemed most troublesome in the Butler Township, Drums and Rock Glen precincts, it soon began appearing elsewhere around the county.\\n\\nEyewitness News has learned the problem appears to be more widespread, however, with the same \"glitch\" being reported in Columbia, Carbon and Monroe Counties and in other parts of central Pennsylvania.\\n\\nElections officials say in each case they\\'ve been made aware of, the voter was able to cast an accurate vote for the candidate of their choice - saying there was no \"vote flipping\" occurring at the polling stations.\\n\\nLuzerne County Bureau of Elections Director Marissa Crispell says initially there appeared to be a calibration problem with some machines. \"You might select a straight Democrat party ticket, and it would send you to the Green party. It was an obvious problem, which was easily fixed when brought to the attention of poll workers.\"\\n\\nOfficials also indicated some of the problem might be due to \"voter error\" as many voters aren\\'t familiar with the wide variety of electronic voting machines being used in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nThe problems in Luzerne County are indicative of the suspicion many voters have in the outcome of the 2016 election, especially the presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump has campaigned for weeks on what he\\'s called a \"rigged election\".\\n\\nEarlier in the day, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Pedro Cortes dismissed Trump\\'s allegations, telling Eyewitness News during a live interview from the state capitol in Harrisburg that Pennsylvania has a good, secure voting system.\\n\\n\"It is unfortunate that it has been some of the talk of this election, he said. \"Pennsylvania has a very good history of running elections that are fair, that are smooth, that you can trust. Elections are not perfect, but they are legitimate and there\\'s no basis to substantiate those claims. It\\'s important for voters to know that our machines in Pennsylvania are not connected to the internet, they\\'re not even connected to each other.\"',\n",

       " \"The federal government and most states are throwing away $28 billion in yearly tax revenue by not legalizing marijuana, according to a new analysis from the Tax Foundation, an independent think tank.\\n\\nThe bulk of that revenue -- $20.5 billion of it -- would accrue to states through the collection of excise taxes on marijuana sales, general sales taxes, and income and payroll taxes levied on workers and businesses in a mature legal marijuana industry.\\n\\nThe federal government would take in another $7.5 billion, primarily from income and payroll taxes, and $500 million in excise taxes if marijuana were to be taxed the same way tobacco is.\\n\\nThese are estimates relying on a certain number of assumptions about the size of the marijuana market ($45 billion in sales annually) and the ways that governments decide to tax the sale of the drug. For instance, if the federal government decided to slap a 10 percent surtax on marijuana sales rather than a tobacco-style per-pound tax, that $500 million excise tax figure would grow to $5.3 billion.\\n\\nAs German Lopez points out over at Vox, these figures account for just a tiny slice of annual government spending in the United States, so don't expect to balance your state budget on the backs of marijuana smokers any time soon.\\n\\n[Something interesting happens to weed after it's legal]\\n\\nStill, $28 billion is nothing to scoff at. The Tax Foundation analysis points out that marijuana tax revenues in Colorado and Washington are exceeding projections by a considerable margins. Colorado initially projected it would receive $70 million in annual taxes on marijuana sales and excise taxes, but it is on track to pull in $140 million this year. The money goes to fund things like school construction and drug abuse-prevention campaigns.\\n\\nCritics point out that marijuana legalization carries some social costs too as people may become more likely to abuse the drug and suffer the negative consequences of abuse and addiction, if the drug is more widely available.\\n\\nBut as the Tax Foundation analysis points out, people are already using and abusing marijuana -- regardless of legality. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, over 13 percent of Americans age 12 and older, 0r 35 million people, used marijuana in 2014. And 4.2 million of them met criteria for substance abuse or dependence.\\n\\nWe're already paying the social cost of marijuana abuse, in other words. Increased tax revenues could help offset those costs.\\n\\nAnd marijuana prohibition carries a whole host of costs of its own -- roughly a half-billion dollars a year to arrest people for simple marijuana possession. Billions more to arrest and prosecute people who sell and traffic the drug. And the difficult-to-quantify cost of restricting the ability of millions of people who would prefer to use a drug that, by any reasonable metric, is considerably less harmful than alcohol.\\n\\nMore from Wonkblog:\\n\\nHow police took $53,000 from a Christian band, an orphanage and a church\\n\\nStoned drivers are a lot safer than drunk ones, new federal data show\\n\\nThese 'marijuana goggles' are supposed to make you feel stoned\",\n",

It\\'s the first time a top draft prospect has been shut out of the Big 3 of kicks corporations.\\n\\nThat\\'s because LaVar Ball has pushed for a co-branded partnership with whichever company intends to sign him, which would allow Big Baller Brand to operate underneath the parent umbrella. That\\'s like Jordan Brand, which signs athletes and has its own sneaker line as part of the Nike family.\\n\\nBall has also set the bar high, claiming he and his sons will settle for no less than a combined $1 billion deal over the life of the contract. That prompted Nike CEO Phil Knight to call Ball\\'s asking price \"a bit steep,\" and company consultant George Raveling to call Ball himself \"the worst thing to happen to basketball in the last hundred years.\"\\n\\nLonzo Ball is projected as the No. 2 overall pick in the upcoming draft after an impressive freshman season leading the UCLA Bruins to a Sweet 16 appearance in the NCAA tournament.\\n\\nHow does that price tag compare with other NBA stars\\' footwear?\\n\\nIt would rank Lonzo ahead of the league\\'s stars with the priciest basketball kicks out.\\n\\nLeBron James\\' LeBron XIV retails at $175, with the customizable XIV iD series ringing up $220 before tax. Kevin Durant\\'s latest KD9 comes in at $150, while James Harden\\'s Harden Vol. 1 Series with Adidas run $140. Under Armour debuted Steph Curry\\'s Curry 3\\'s at $149.99, but has since slashed the price to $99.99.\\n\\nAnd Paul George\\'s debut sneaker, the PG1, hit shelves this year at $109.99.\\n\\nFor some players, sneaker price is a status symbol.

       " 'Republicans launched an unprecedented frontal assault against environmental protections and regulations this year, prompting Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) to call his chamber \"the most anti-environment House in history.\" Here are the 10 most powerful and outspoken opponents of clean air, clean water, conservation and climate action.\\n\\n10. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Thought to be the biggest lifetime recipient of oil-industry contributions in the Senate, Cornyn has rewarded Exxon-Mobil\\'s largesse by supporting the industry\\'s position on pretty much every energy or environmental issue that has ever appeared before him. That\\'s why he, like everyone on this list, has a \"0\" on the League of Conservation Voters\\' scorecard for pro-environment votes.\\n\\n9. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska. A tireless advocate for opening Alaska\\'s pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Young was involved in one of the more entertaining name-calling spats in Congress this year when he got into a tiff over the refuge with author and professor Doug Brinkley. You can be the judge of who won by watching the video replay.\\n\\n8. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. There may have been a time when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee lived up to its name, investigating and bringing to light incidents of government waste, fraud and abuse. But I can\\'t remember back that far. In recent decades it has served as a tool for the majority party in the House to bash and embarrass the presidential administration, at least during times such as now when the House isn\\'t controlled by the president\\'s party. Issa, the committee\\'s current chairman, has turned such political gamesmanship into an art form, and has been particularly keen to attack environmental regulators and policymakers. In so doing he has turned up precious little waste or fraud, but provided plenty of political theater for those who want to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency or end subsidies for clean energy.\\n\\n7. Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio. Latta has the distinction of sponsoring the most far-reaching and destructive amendment to the most egregious anti-environment bill passed by the House this year. The TRAIN Act, approved by the House in September but not expected to get through the Senate, is a breathtaking (literally) gift to polluters that creates a committee to study the costs but ignore the benefits of environmental regulation, while also blocking EPA efforts to crack down on deadly emissions from power plants. Latta\\'s contribution is an amendment that undermines a cornerstone of the Clean Air Act, requiring the EPA to take industry costs into account when setting health-based standards. This would allow corporate polluters to overrule scientists and strikes at the heart of the polluter-pays principle that has guided environmental policy for 40 years.\\n\\n6. Rep. Edward Whitfield, R-Ky. Another architect of the TRAIN wreck, Whitfield offered an amendment that would block the EPA from regulating mercury and other toxics from power plants, and from coming up with a rule on smog and soot that crosses state lines. Together, these two regulations would save an estimated 51,000 lives per year. But what are a few thousand lives when utility profits are at stake?\\n\\n5. Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla. One of the most outspoken climate-change deniers in the Senate (he\\'s renowned for calling global warming \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\"), Inhofe is also one of the most influential Republicans in the country when it comes to environmental policy. As ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, he uses his position to push for expanded oil drilling and reduce environmental regulation. Inhofe sometimes even finds himself to the right of the polluter-packed U.S. Chamber of Commerce; this summer he placed a hold on President Obama\\'s nominee John Bryson as Commerce secretary, even though Bryson had the blessing of the Chamber, because Inhofe felt Bryson was too pro-environment.\\n\\n4. Rep. Michael Simpson, R-Idaho. Simpson has stepped to the front lines of his party\\'s war on Mother Nature by adding dozens of anti-environment riders to must-pass budget legislation. Among other things, Simpson aims to let mountaintop coal-mining operations continue to pollute streams, prevent the EPA from regulating coal-ash disposal, and exempt pesticide sprayers from complying with the Clean Water Act.\\n\\n3. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. The enforcer of Republican Party discipline, Senate Minority Leader McConnell is among the key architects of his party\\'s stance on environmental issues.

Bailey has been charged with driving with an alcohol level of more than 80 milligrams. It is the third time Bailey has been before the courts on driving charges. (Feb. 5, 2004) ( Hans Deryk / Toronto Star File Photo ) Donovan Bailey\\'s iconic pose after winning the 100-metre sprint in world record time at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. ( Toronto Star File Photo )\\n\\nBailey, 44, was not at College Park Court on Monday for a first appearance on a charge, commonly referred to as \"being over .08.\" Bailey, who gave his address to the Toronto police who stopped him as St. James, Jamaica, was reportedly in his native country Monday promoting the upcoming London Olympics where he is to be a TV commentator for the Canadian media consortium covering the games. The matter was put over to June 11 for a pre-trial conference.\\n\\nArticle Continued Below\\n\\nAccording to the information filed in court, Bailey was stopped by police on March 28 in Toronto and administered the breathalyzer test. The police record does not say where or what time of day Bailey was stopped by police in the downtown 51 Division. This is the third time the Canadian icon — a five-time world and Olympic champion and inductee into Canada\\'s Sports Hall of Fame — has been before the courts on driving related charges. Bailey captured the hearts of Canadians at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he won the gold medal and set a new world record of 9.84 in the 100-metre sprint. Two years later his image was somewhat tarnished. In May 1998, Bailey was fined $200 for failing to report an accident after he left the scene of a single-car cash that totalled his $80,000 Mercedes.\\n\\nThe car, awarded to him for a gold medal performance at the 1995 track and field championships in Sweden, struck a concrete utility pole, flipped over and caught fire. Bailey emerged from the wreck without injury. Passersby offered to get him medical attention but Bailey refused and asked to be driven home instead. Police arrived at his home five hours later.\\n\\nArticle Continued Below\\n\\nAt the time, Crown Attorney Paul Renwick told the court that a more serious charge of careless driving was withdrawn because there was \"no reasonable prospect of a conviction.\" Bailey was assessed three demerit points over the accident. Three years later, in December 2001, Bailey was convicted of driving a Mercedes-Benz 200 kilometres an hour on the Queen Elizabeth Way and fined $975. An Ontario Provincial Police officer testified he tracked Bailey\\'s black Mercedes doing 200 km/h in the slow lane of the westbound QEW between Mississauga Rd. and Erin Mills Parkway at 3:34 in the morning. Bailey lived in Oakville at the time, but apparently has since sold his mansion there. \"He runs fast and he drives fast, except now he\\'s going to slow down,\" his lawyer Paul Stunt said as he left court. Bailey was at a track meet in Italy at the time and did not appear in court. Under the Highway Traffic Act Bailey lost six demerit points but his licence was not suspended. After his racing career ended Bailey started his own company called DBX Sport Management, which helps amateur athletes find ways to promote themselves, and a sports injury clinic in Oakville, Ont. If convicted of the current charge Bailey faces a fine and licence suspension.',\n",

After being hired on the spot, the 17-year-old was told she\\'d be making $8 an hour — slightly higher than the state\\'s $7.25 minimum. She was also thrilled to find out she\\'d be working alongside a friend of hers named Jake Reed.\\n\\nThat excitement didn\\'t last long; she soon discovered that Reed, who was also 17, had comparable work experience, and was working the same position, was hired at $8.25 an hour.\\n\\nWalcott told Fox Kansas City that when she called her manager to ask about the pay difference, she was initially put on hold.\\n\\n\"I was like maybe when I\\'m on hold right now, she will just offer me $8.25 and everything is gonna be good but... she didn\\'t do that,\" Walcott said. When she was taken off hold, her manager fired her, saying she could do so because \"discussing wages is against its policy.\"\\n\\nA similar fate met Reed. \"She said you\\'re fired. Basically just like a 10 second phone call,\" he told Fox.\\n\\nAs attorney David White confirms, the National Labor Relations Board maintains that employees may discuss pay with each other, meaning that Walcott was in the right. He thinks that Walcott and Reed may have a case against the Calabasas, California-based pizza chain, though the two haven\\'t decided yet if they will take legal action.\\n\\nAs the American Association of University Women found, for the year 2014, women in Kansas earned just $0.79 for each dollar men in Kansas did. That rate is slightly higher in California.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Pizza Studio recently opened its second Bay Area franchise location inside Concord\\'s Sunvalley Mall.\\n\\nUPDATE: Pizza Studio has responded to SFGATE\\'s request for comment, saying that after fully investigating the incident, that \"gender did not play a role in determination of either salary, nor for any Pizza Studio employee.\" Ashleigh Siefker, the organization\\'s Executive Director of Operations, says that she has \"personally instituted policies and procedures that strictly prohibit discrimination of any kind.\"\\n\\nSiefker adds:\\n\\n\"After an in-depth review, we are confident this instance was not one of gender-bias but rather a failure to assign the correct salary and a misunderstanding of our company policies by one of our employees; it should be noted the manager in communication with Miss Walcott is also a female.\\n\\n\"Pizza Studio did not agree however with how the manager handled the situation. We pride ourselves with treating our employees and guests with respect and open communication at all times.

       " 'The simplest sports betting math many punters possess is the ability to convert odds and calculate break even percentages, also known as implied probabilities. After spending years doing these calculations, first on a windows calculator, and later in an excel spread sheet, I finally developed the Intense Gambling odds converter you\\'ll find below.\\n\\nOdds Converter Tool\\n\\n[oddscalc]\\n\\nIn case you\\'re not familiar with the difference between American Odds called moneylines and European odds, which are in decimal format, here is how each works.\\n\\nAmerican Odds\\n\\nAlso known as moneylines, are offered as either a positive or negative number. When positive, the moneyline represents how much profit a punter stands to make on a $100 stake. To give an example, a line of +125 represents risk $100 to win $125 profit. Negative moneylines represent how much a punter needs to stake for a winning bet to profit $100. A moneyline of -235 is risk $235 to win $100 profit.\\n\\nEuropean Odds\\n\\nAlso known as decimal odds, represent how much a winning ticket is worth for each dollar staked. For example if a punter wagers $10.00 at odds 1.95 and wins, their payout is $10 x 1.95 = $19.50. A major difference between American and European odds is that while the American version is based on profit, the European version is based on return. Likewise, a $10 wager on odds 1.95 translates to risk $10.00 to potentially profit $9.50. Considering 1.95 pays less than even money, it would be expressed in American odds format as a negative moneyline.\\n\\nThe best way to convert American odds to European format, and vice versa, is to use the \"odds converter\" located above. For those of you interested in the math, I\\'ll cover it great detail later in this article. First let me discuss break even percentage and implied probability.\\n\\nImplied Probability\\n\\nIs how often a bet must win for it to have neutral value. To give the simplest example, take American odds +100 (which is the equivalent of 2.00 in European odds) where winning bets are paid even money, here the implied probability is 50%. This is because in American format risk $100 to win $100, and in European format stake $1 to return $2, you\\'ll need to win an average of 50% of the time to break even over the long haul.\\n\\nWhere our odds converter comes in handy is let\\'s say you\\'ve done an analysis on a game between the Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays and determined the Red Sox should be 57% favorites in this game. After price shopping, the best odds you can find on the Red Sox are -128, which in European format is 1.781. There are now two ways you can determine if you\\'ve found a good bet. The first method is to plug 57% into our odds converter under the required break even field. Doing this you\\'ll find at 57% the true odds in American format are -132.6 (1.754 European). Consider you\\'re getting better than this with the -128 (1.781 European) you have a profitable bet.\\n\\nThe second way you could approach the above problem, is to plug -128 into our odds converted under American odds. Here you\\'ll see the required break even rate (implied probability) is 56.14%. Considering your calculation of a 57% win probability comes out higher than the win rate needed to break even, you\\'ve find yourself a good bet.\\n\\nSports Betting Strategy You Should, but Most Don\\'t, Understand\\n\\nFor those with basic sports betting math skills, the sample problem I\\'m about to give will be easy to solve. If you\\'re stumped, or answer incorrectly, what you\\'re about to read could very well be what gets you on the path required to winning consistently at sports betting.\\n\\nThe sample\\n\\nEvery online betting site with odds on a NBA basketball game between the Orlando Magic and Sacramento Kings has the odds listed in American format as Magic -545 / Kings +445.\\n\\nSomeone comes long and says \"I\\'ll offer you either Magic -490 or Kings +490, your choice\". Which of these options, if any, has the highest expected value?\\n\\nThe way many sports bettors would approach this is to average out 545 and 445 and figure the fair value is about -495 / +495. Using this failed logic they\\'d end up taking the Magic -490 as that\\'s better than the fair price and must be +EV. The problem is neither American nor European odds work this way; they can\\'t be averaged out to calculate the fair value.\\n\\nThe first step those who understand sports betting math take to solve this problem is the conversion of Magic -545 / Kings +445 to break even percentages.\\n\\nAfter plugging the odds',\n",
       " 'Question. Hi Mike: Is there a way to use fireplace ash that would be beneficial to my garden or lawn? If not, what is the best way to dispose of the stuff? ---Chris in Berwyn, PA (formerly Newport, RI)\\n\\nMike: Like many of my neighbors here in Eastern Carolina, I have a \\'burn pile\\' where I dispose of storm debris, old trimmed branches (mainly pine and oak) and all manner of other garden/yard items. My question is: Is the leftover ash good for anything? I know better than to put it in the compost pile. Thanks,\\n\\n---Doug in Beaufort, NC\\n\\nAnswer. Thank you, Doug. As you note, I\\'ve long cautioned gardeners not to include anything other than very small quantities of wood ash in a compost pile—a little of this highly alkaline material goes a long way. But those of us with naturally acidic soils can (and should) use much larger amounts on our lawns and gardens—as a substitute for lime.\\n\\nBefore we get to that, however, I\\'d like to take a moment to try and pry your incendiary little fingers away from those piles. Yes, we guys love to set stuff on fire—especially in the name of \\'yard work\\'. But such burning fouls the air, adds greenhouse gases we don\\'t need, and wastes lots of nutrients. Pile up your \"garden/yard\" items and they\\'ll turn into nice compost, especially with lots of leaves in the mix. Stack the branches on the outskirts of your property to provide habitat for toads, birds and other beneficials. (And you\\'ll find a surprising amount of compost at the bottom of those piles after a few years.) If you can\\'t go completely \\'burn turkey\\', consider cutting back to one small bonfire a year to satisfy your inner firebug, and get better use out of the rest of that wood.\\n\\nAnd good quality hardwood ashes—that means no ashes from BBQ grills, cardboard, plywood, painted, or pressure treated wood—do have real agricultural use. (Softwoods have a lot less value, but you shouldn\\'t be burning soft wood in a stove or fireplace anyway.) The best information on how to properly utilize the valuable material in wood ash is contained in a couple of great farm-scale articles from the Georgia Extension Service and the government of Alberta\\'s department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. We\\'ll post links to those articles at this end of this Q of the Week for those of you who want all the details.\\n\\nTo help put the advice into garden-size perspective, we turned to Julia Gaskin, a Land Application Specialist for the University of Georgia Extension Service who recently updated their wood ash information article. She explains that ash from good quality hardwoods contains a very nice amount of potassium; at least 3% by weight. Also known as potash, this is the \"K\" in the fabled N-P-K scale of plant nutrients—the Dow Jones of Horticulture! Potash improves root health and strengthens the very cellular structure of plants, helping them resist all kinds of stresses.\\n\\nWood Ash also contains lots of micronutrients, and, on average, 15% calcium—a nutrient often lacking in many of our soils and fertilizers. Ashes even improve the structure and tilth of soils. But they must be used with care, as all that calcium makes them highly alkaline—a range of 9 to 13—and they WILL change your soil\\'s pH. But that\\'s OK, because that\\'s exactly what you going to be using them to do.\\n\\nSo the first thing you need is a soiltest. I know—I always say that. And I\\'m always right! This time double, because you\\'ll be using those ashes to actively change the pH of your soil and you need to know where you\\'re starting from.\\n\\nAll soil tests report pH—the measure of your soil\\'s acidity or alkalinity. The center of this scale is the number 7, the scientific neutral. I say \\'scientific\\', because most plants prefer soil to be a little acidic, around 6.5, for good growth. Some of our most popular plants, however, require a highly acidic soil (in the 4 to 5.5 range) to survive: azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, mums, marigolds, mountainlaurel, oak,pecan and sweet potato to name a few. Keep your alkaline ashes far away from these and other acid lovers.\\n\\nBut many parts of the country—especially areas with heavy rainfall—have soils that are naturally down in that highly acidic range, which your regular plants do not enjoy one bit. Normally people use lime to correct this, which is why soil test results often include a \"liming recommendation\", specifying how many pounds of lime per thousand square feet to add to your lawn or garden to bring the pH up to around',\n",

       " 'In 1963, Lynda Gunn was asked by her grandfather, a private-school athletic director in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, to model for a buddy of his who was a painter. Gunn, who was eight years old at the time, spent a few sessions wearing a fancy white dress and standing stock still in a walking position—her feet were balanced on wooden blocks to simulate the appearance of being in motion—being sketched and photographed by Norman Rockwell. Rockwell used her image in his celebrated work \"The Problem We All Live With\": the painting depicts Ruby Bridges, who in 1960 became the first African-American girl to enroll in an all-white Southern elementary school. In it, Gunn-as-Bridges approaches her first day of school flanked by federal marshals, the wall behind her defaced by a graffito slur. Last summer, President Obama requested that the painting, which is in the collection of the Norman Rockwell Museum, in Stockbridge, be loaned to the White House, where it was displayed on a wall outside the Oval Office.\\n\\nGunn, a taciturn, thoughtful woman who works as a night auditor at the Super 8 Motel in Lee, Massachusetts, was invited to New York recently, to view a series of paintings by Philip Maysles, which are hanging on the wall of the Red Rooster, a restaurant in Harlem owned by Marcus Samuelsson. In one, Maysles—who is the son of Albert Maysles, the documentarian—has drawn \"The Problem We All Live With\" as it appeared while on exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, complete with a book for comments, in 2006. (A reproduction of the Houston comments book—\"The more things change the more they stay the same\"; \"Security keeps following us\"—is provided at the Red Rooster. Guests are invited to contribute their own comments, in a different color ink.) In another, he has drawn Gunn, schoolbooks in hand, being carefully positioned by her father, David Gunn, Jr., in Rockwell\\'s book-lined studio. Another painting, a rendering of Rockwell\\'s famous self-portrait in which Rockwell\\'s face on the canvas has been replaced by Gunn\\'s profile, is, Maysles said, his own oblique self-portrait. Over lunch with Gunn and Jane Allen Petrick, a writer who is working on a book about the real people of color whom Rockwell used as models, and who had initiated the encounter, Maysles explained, \"A lot of my work is exploring white identity, and how whiteness is constructed in relation to images people have of black folk.\"\\n\\nGunn told Maysles that, like Ruby Bridges, she had been the only black child in her elementary school, though for different sociological reasons. Her family had been in Stockbridge for generations, and her grandfather was a well-known figure in the community. \"It was a very sheltered experience—I just got to be a child,\" she said. Although members of her family were active in the N.A.A.C.P., she did not feel affected by the nation\\'s larger racial tensions until she was older. The only time she felt singled out for being different was when her classmates read \"Little Black Sambo.\" \"Everyone would turn around and look at me,\" she said. \"But it wasn\\'t traumatic. It was just a moment.\" As an adult, she found that her Yankee accent provided a measure of cultural camouflage. \"I\\'ve gotten a lot of job interviews—on the phone, it\\'s one thing, but when I show up, the jaws drop,\" she said.\\n\\nAt the Red Rooster, Gunn was fêted. The kitchen sent out complimentary pumpkin soup and macaroni-and-cheese; a hefty cookbook was pressed upon her; Samuelsson stopped by to grasp her hand. Gunn said she was honored to have participated in the making of an icon, though she admitted she would have preferred royalties over the ten dollars per session that she was paid by Rockwell. It might also have been nice, she added, to have been invited to the White House to view the painting, as was Ruby Bridges, who is the founder of the Ruby Bridges Foundation. \"But I wasn\\'t expecting anything, so I\\'m not disappointed,\" Gunn said. She has largely stopped participating in events around \"The Problem We All Live With.\" She said, \"It got to be too much—\\'Will you come and sign autographs,\\' for nothing, so I stopped.\"\\n\\n\"Do you feel resentment toward me?\" Maysles asked.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not resentful,\" Gunn said, quietly. \"I\\'m happy to see you went somewhere with it.\" When Maysles asked her to sign a postcard-size reproduction of \"Self-Portrait of Norman Rockwell as Ruby Bridges,\" Gunn signed her name boldly across the blue shirtsleeve of the artist\\'s painting arm. ♦',\n",

       " 'At the workplace, Indian millennials are faced with more than just simple work pressure.\\n\\nMore than 40% of respondents to an online survey by a Harvard Business Review digital learning platform said that excessive workload was the main barrier to efficiency at the workplace. Office politics, cited by just over 39% of respondents, was a close second.\\n\\nHarvard Business Review (HBR) Ascend surveyed approximately 1,700 people aged between 18 and 34 from various industries in India to understand the challenges they encounter at work. Among millennials, \"the more tenured group (aged between 25-34) felt that excessive workload is their top barrier (42.92% respondents), while the younger millennials (18-24 years) identified office politics (42.39% of the respondents) as the main pain point,\" Vivek Chachra, India manager, Harvard Business Publishing, noted in a press release. The workload was a bigger concern for men, while it was office politics for women, the survey found. It is important to note, however, that women represented a smaller proportion (22.17%) of the entire pool.\\n\\nMoreover, though most Indian millennials are equipped with technical skills, the survey suggests that they lack four key building blocks for a successful career: emotional intelligence, stress management, persuasion, and analytical thinking. Only 13% of the respondents thought they displayed emotional intelligence at work. A dismal 8% felt analytical thinking \"is an area of strength for them,\" and a meagre 4.5% \"agreed that they had the persuasion skills needed to be successful at the workplace,\" the survey noted.\\n\\nIn systems plagued by rote learning, academic excellence has always been the top, if not the only, priority. Consequently, soft skills have taken a backseat at schools and higher education institutes in India. And HBR Ascend isn\\'t alone in noting such a deficit. Studies by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and global management consultancy Hay Group have found that a lack of soft skills has impeded communication, self-awareness, and self-management among India\\'s workforce.\\n\\nAnd the struggle is likely to worsen as office landscapes change.\\n\\n\"Soft skills like empathy, emotional intelligence, and persuasion will be even more critical as workspaces become more dynamic and machine-human interplay rapidly evolves,\" Amit Aggarwal, senior vice-president of learning & development at Genpact, a global business process management and services firm, said in a statement.',\n",

       " 'At a site near the Southwest Alaska village of Quinhagak archaeologists are racing against time to uncover Yup\\'ik artifacts before the effects of climate change cause them to erode into the sea. The old village continues to reveal artifacts that give a glimpse into the daily lives of Yup\\'ik people hundreds of years ago.\\n\\nThe crowning artifact found this season, says Rick Knecht, the lead archaeologist and a professor from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, is a mask — half human, half walrus — in nearly perfect condition. It\\'s wrapped in several layers of plastic as Knecht keeps the mask damp and cool in a refrigerator at base camp.\\n\\n\"It\\'s got amazingly lifelike contours with the cheek bones, and the nose, and the forehead and so on. Beautifully carved out of wood, and as you can see it\\'s got two little conical tusks that represent that transformation into a walrus. And these are in fact made out of walrus ivory. It\\'s got a little beard here, and half of it are human hairs and then on the other half are sea mammal hairs, maybe walrus whiskers,\" said Knecht.\\n\\n\\nKnecht says the mask could have been a used by a Shaman. He unearthed it, about five miles outside Quinhagak, on the edge of the Bering Sea, where archaeologists have spent the six field seasons scraping dirt from the remains of a 500-year old Alaska Native sod house. Today\\'s discovery of a wooden bowl gives another clue about how Yup\\'ik people lived.\\n\\n\"On the bottom of the bentwood bowl is an ownership mark left by the person who carved that and these ownership marks were inherited between families. We have about six or seven ownership marks we see consistently throughout this site, which we believe was a very large sod house divided up into compartments which were domestic spaces for women and children,\" said Knecht.\\n\\nHis team has found tens of thousands of household items, jewelry and weapons, among other things. The dig is composed of what\\'s left of an entire village at the site of the ancient community of Arolik.\\n\\nThe objects look much younger than the centuries they\\'ve endured. That\\'s because they\\'ve been encased in permafrost. Wood and leather items can survive for hundreds of years. The oldest objects date as far back as seven hundred years.\\n\\nUnseasonably warm temperatures at the dig site– nearly 80 degrees- create another set of variables for the crew to deal with. Conditions that Knecht say are driving the crew to work as fast as possible before more washes away.\\n\\nIn the early 1600s, right around the time that Shakespeare was publishing plays and poems in England, Knecht says, these people were crafting art too: carving intricate ivory jewelry and weaving baskets. Then, in the middle of the 17thCentury, says Knecht, their communal, sod house was attacked and burned.\\n\\nCarlotta Hillerdal is a co-investigator with Knecht on the project. Back at the dig, she points to a burnt orange streak running along the dark soil of the dig\\'s dirt wall.\\n\\n\"This site was abandoned around 1640. So that\\'s where we have the kind of orange and black soil that you see in the wall over there that we dug. That\\'s the roof of the last phase of the structure that stood here that was burnt down and abandoned,\" said Hillerdal.\\n\\nThe evidence at the site corresponds with local Yup\\'ik lore about the \\'bow and arrow wars,\\' a time of fighting between tribes during an earlier climate change that strained resources.\\n\\nThose are stories that Yup\\'ik elder Annie Cleveland knows. She says, when she was a girl, she remembers walking on the beach just outside of her village and finding old spears and human remains along the shore.\\n\\n\"When my grandmother and I used to walk down the beach to get some driftwood or pick berries we used to find spear-anek (spears) and maybe a human bone and skull and we used to put the bones back up there and dig a little bit and cover them,\" said Cleveland.\\n\\nThat spot where she and her grandmother kept reburying things has turned into the dig called Nunalleq, meaning \\'old village\\'. Cleveland says the project is bringing to life history for Yup\\'ik people in her village and giving them a sense of pride. The Native corporation in Quinhagak eventually wants to develop eco-tourism around the site, but rapid erosion has made getting artifacts out the priority.\\n\\nAs they dig, researchers are finding that the village is larger than expected.

       " 'A smorgasbord of early concept art and animation detailing Naughty Dog\\'s early vision for Uncharted has been revealed.\\n\\nIn a feature at The Verge, Uncharted writer Josh Scherr goes over Naughty Dog\\'s thought process at the time and includes the original pitch video for Uncharted - then codenamed Project Big - that sold the title to Sony.\\n\\nAs you can see from the screenshot below, Nathan Drake sure looked a lot different in these early stages. His face was more plucky, cartoonish and expressive.\\n\\nThen the studio cast a then unknown character actor named Nolan North for the part and everything changed. \"When Nolan came in, it was fairly clear that he was going to be the one,\" Scherr reminisced. \"He had that right kind of devil may care feel to his voice, but he could also get serious when he needed to. And most importantly, as we discovered, is that the guy was hilarious.\"\\n\\nNorth was also able to provide motion capture and he had the perfect physicality for the role. One of the features Scherr was most proud of was \"additive animation\" meaning the animations would change based on context. For example, Drake sprints differently when he\\'s being shot at versus when he\\'s not. In danger, he\\'ll panic and flail his arms around wildly whereas when he\\'s leisurely running he\\'ll remain cool and collected. \"It looks very simple now compared to [how it looked] back then,\" Scherr said. \"But we were doing a lot of things that we had never tried before.\"\\n\\nNot everything from the pitch video made it into the final game. The underwater bits were cut, as was the multi-enemy hand-to-hand combat system where you could steal weapons from foes. Amazingly, the jet ski level was built in less than a month at the 11th hour.\\n\\nNaughty Dog\\'s biggest aspiration with Uncharted was design a game where the narrative was front and center, rather than a flimsy excuse for action sequences. \"The thing that we wanted to focus on from the get-go were characters and story,\" Scherr said. \"That was something we felt that - particularly back in 2005, 2006 when this first started getting developed - was something that was sort of an afterthought in the majority of video games out there. So we really wanted not only to tell this pulpy, action adventure-style thing, but also really try to develop some relatable, entertaining characters and have the story be what pulled you through the game.\"\\n\\nUncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection will be out on 9th October and will include access to the Uncharted 4 multiplayer beta running from 4th-13th December.',\n",

       " 'One of the women accusing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange of sex crimes appears to have worked with a group that has connections to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\\n\\nJames D. Catlin, a lawyer who recently represented Assange, said the sex assault investigation into the WikiLeaks founder is based on claims he didn\\'t use condoms during sex with two Swedish women.\\n\\nSPONSORED\\n\\nSwedish prosecutors told AOL News last week that Assange was not wanted for rape as has been reported, but for something called \"sex by surprise\" or \"unexpected sex.\"\\n\\nOne accuser, Anna Ardin, may have \"ties to the US-financed anti-Castro and anti-communist groups,\" according to Israel Shamir and Paul Bennett, writing for CounterPunch.\\n\\nWhile in Cuba, Ardin worked with the Las damas de blanco (the Ladies in White), a feminist anti-Castro group.\\n\\nProfessor Michael Seltzer pointed out that the group is led by Carlos Alberto Montaner who is reportedly connected to the CIA.\\n\\nShamir and Bennett also describe Ardin as a \"leftist\" who \"published her anti-Castro diatribes (see here and here) in the Swedish-language publication Revista de Asignaturas Cubanas put out by Misceláneas de Cuba.\"\\n\\nShamir and Bennett noted that Las damas de blanco is partially funded by the US government and also counts Luis Posada Carriles as a supporter.\\n\\nA declassified 1976 document (.pdf) revealed Posada to be a CIA agent. He has been convicted of terrorist attacks that killed hundreds of people.\\n\\nArdin is \"a gender equity officer at Uppsula University – who chose to associate with a US funded group openly supported by a convicted terrorist and mass murderer,\" FireDogLake\\'s Kirk James Murphy observed.\\n\\nIn August, Assange told Al-Jazeera that the accusations were \"clearly a smear campaign.\"\\n\\n\"We have been warned that, for example, the Pentagon is planning on using dirty tricks to destroy our work,\" Assange told the Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet.\\n\\nThe WikiLeaks founder said he was told to be careful of \"sex traps.\" Had Assange fallen for one of those traps? \"Maybe. Maybe not,\" he said.\\n\\nCatlin observed that both Ardin and Sofia Wilén, the second accuser, sent SMS messages and tweets boasting of their conquests following the alleged \"rapes.\"\\n\\n\"In the case of Ardin it is clear that she has thrown a party in Assange\\'s honour at her flat after the \\'crime\\' and tweeted to her followers that she is with the \\'the world\\'s coolest smartest people, it\\'s amazing!\\'\" he wrote.\\n\\n\"The exact content of Wilén\\'s mobile phone texts is not yet known but their bragging and exculpatory character has been confirmed by Swedish prosecutors. Niether Wilén\\'s nor Ardin\\'s texts complain of rape,\" Catlin said.\\n\\nArdin has also published a seven step guide on how to get revenge on cheating boyfriends.\\n\\nWhen the charges were first leveled in August, Gawker raised doubts that Ardin was working for the CIA.\\n\\n\"If anything, Ardin\\'s outing tends to undercut Assange\\'s conspiracy theory that one of his accusers is a major figure on Sweden\\'s left fringe, freewheelingly indiscreet on her personal blog and, until her charges, an enthusiastic promoter of Assange\\'s visit to the country,\" Gawker wrote.\\n\\nAfter Interpol issued a digital \"wanted\" poster for Assange on Monday morning, an unnamed Scotland Yard source reportedly told Press Association it had been given the documents needed for the arrest. Police would not comment on the report publicly.\\n\\nSeveral British news outlets speculated that Assange could be arrested as early as Tuesday.\\n\\nOn Monday evening, Mark Stephens, Assange\\'s London lawyer, was negotiating with British authorities over an arrest warrant they\\'d received from their Swedish counterparts.

       " 'Kristen Bell had no idea the commotion she would cause with husband Dax Shepard when she recorded her voice cameo for iZombie.\\n\\nThe Veronica Mars alum is reuniting with series creator Rob Thomas on his new series by lending her voice for Episode 11, titled \"Fifty Shades of Grey Matter.\" In the episode, Liv (Rose McIver) eats the brain of a poisoned librarian, voiced by Bell, who was also secretly an erotic fiction writer.\\n\\n\"[Thomas] said, \\'Just record it on your phone, send it to me and we\\'ll lay it into the episode,\\'\" Bell said in a conference call with reporters. \"I was sitting in my husband\\'s trailer while he was shooting [his new movie] CHiPs while both my kids were sleeping in the bedroom of the trailer, and I was like, \\'Oh, I have a moment away from them! I\\'ll get it done.\\' So I wrote out my lines, which was a paragraph or two of erotica. I recorded it on my phone and sent it to Rob.\"\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until Bell and Shepard were home later that night when she realized she accidentally set something in motion.\\n\\n\"Dax starts to tell me that the weirdest thing happened to him at work. Somebody slipped him a piece of erotica into his trailer, and he was confused as to who did it,\" Bell said. \"He was trying to find out who wanted him to read their stuff, because he\\'s a writer and he passes stuff onto other writers. He was utterly confused, and thank God he told me about it, because otherwise he would have thought someone on the set of CHiPs was writing erotica and slipping it into his trailer in the hopes that he was enjoying it or give notes or become his protégé? I don\\'t know. He was like, \\'One of these PAs or other writers on the set, someone slipped me some of their work… and it was really sexy!\\'\"\\n\\nBell reveals she briefly considered letting him believe someone on set was slipping him their provocative writing before eventually owning up to it.\\n\\n\"As he was telling me, I was like, \\'Should I let him know that was me, or should I let him think that some gorgeous PA was inspired to write erotica and slipped it under the door of his trailer?\\'\" Bell said with a laugh. \"The funniest part was that he went all Veronica Mars trying to figure the origin of this erotica. He said, \\'I\\'m looking at it, it\\'s written on a piece of paper, it\\'s just sitting there in my trailer, and I noticed that it\\'s written in shorthand. The person who wrote it used the number two instead of the word \\'to,\\' and the letter \\'B\\' instead of the word \\'be.\\' What I\\'m going to do is look over the shoulder of anyone who\\'s writing on a notepad on set for the next couple of weeks and see if I can find who is writing in shorthand.\\' He turned into Veronica Mars to try to figure out the origin of this erotica. It was very funny.\"\\n\\nBoth Bell and Shepard were impressed with what Thomas was able to put together for the episode. \"It was particularly amusing, especially knowing that my friend Rob had written things like, \\'heaving breasts pressed against the cold plastic of the airplane door,\\'\" Bell said with a laugh. \"It was bizarre.\"\\n\\nBell knew that it was only a matter of time (and scheduling) before she became involved with iZombie in some way, although she laments that she only had the time to do a voiceover cameo for the episode. \"Friendship is something that\\'s permanently on the books for Rob and I,\" Bell said. \"There\\'s a constant dialogue about projects and when we can work together again.\"\\n\\nThat could even include another installment of Veronica Mars, which most recently spawned a movie in 2014. However, it sounds like Veronica\\'s next act will bring her back to the small screen.\\n\\n\"We\\'re definitely still looking for the windows where we could allow Veronica to exist again, whether it\\'s a miniseries or a short-run cable series,\" Bell said. \"The business of this business twists it all a little bit when you are only allowed to do one television series at a time. It\\'s tricky. But we haven\\'t dropped the conversation. It just might end up being a Murder, She Wrote where I\\'m 80.\"\\n\\niZombie airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on The CW.',\n",

       " 'by Jason Stotts\\n\\nI think that Leonard Peikoff has done some great things for Objectivism, he is like a demi-Aquinas, but when he talks about sex and sexual issues, it makes me really sad. Frankly, his position on rape is both disgraceful and disgusting. I don\\'t know how anyone of good moral character or intelligence could actually advocate what Peikoff advocated. It is made much worse because Peikoff is someone I respect and I did not expect him to hold such a reprehensible view of rape.\\n\\nI\\'m referring, of course, to his recent Podcast question, episode 202 from February 5th, where Peikoff responds to this question:\\n\\nIs it rape if you obtain sex through fraudulent means? For example a man does not love a woman but tells her he does so that she will have sex with him. Is this the moral equivalent of rape?\\n\\nHis response is:\\n\\nWell, if all she needs it three words, \"I love you,\" and you\\'re not saying it, then it\\'s not an issue of rape. You have to determine, here — before you talk about rape — what is the context. A woman can give her consent by her presence in certain contexts and that frees the man to have sex regardless of what she then says. I\\'m thinking of that case of Kobe Bryant where the woman came up some time in the middle of the night, after some drinking, to his bedroom and then when he purported to do something she said, \"No, I don\\'t consent.\" You cannot do that. You have given every evidence that that is what you\\'re going to do and it is too late at that point to say, \"Sorry, but no.\" So, we\\'re assuming it\\'s not that type of case. You actually have created some kind of false identity, she falls for it, and she never would have [had sex with you] otherwise. Well, that\\'s obviously deception. So, in a sense, it is like rape because she is engaging in the act without her actual consent. Without her knowledge means she would not consent to what you\\'re doing, so you\\'re using fraud, and it is a form of having sex by force. But I don\\'t think you could ever make that a legal crime. Because she says she thought you loved her, but you say you didn\\'t say you loved her. But if it came to the law case, how are you going to decide? What is objective? If a woman says, \"He told me that he loved me and he didn\\'t!\" Any defendant can say, \"I indicated that I had a great admiration for her otherwise I wouldn\\'t want to sleep with her, et cetera, et cetera,\" there is no way of adjudicating what emotions he did or didn\\'t feel or what conversation he did or didn\\'t have. But if there is evidence of physical violence, you know, of a context [such as] she didn\\'t know him, she was walking down the street, et cetera. That\\'s a different story. So. that\\'s what I would say. It\\'s fraud, but in the form you present it is not a legal case.\\n\\nI want to focus, primarily, just on his one claim:\\n\\nA woman can give her consent by her presence in certain contexts and that frees the man to have sex regardless of what she then says. I\\'m thinking of that case of Kobe Bryant where the woman came up some time in the middle of the night, after some drinking, to his bedroom and then when he purported to do something she said, \"No, I don\\'t consent.\" You cannot do that. You have given every evidence that that is what you\\'re going to do and it is too late at that point to say, \"Sorry, but no.\"\\n\\nAnd to make it very clear what I\\'m objecting to:\\n\\nA woman can give her consent by her presence in certain contexts and that frees the man to have sex regardless of what she then says.\\n\\nLeonard Peikoff believes that if a woman were to come to a man\\'s house late at night, dressed sexily, and perhaps drunk, that he should just be able to use her a fuck-toy, even if she says no. Even if she says no. He thinks that the context is sufficient consent and that any other consent is unnecessary. Furthermore, he believes that this consent cannot be withdrawn, which is the most troubling part of his claim.\\n\\nI agree with Peikoff that a woman in the context described above is communicating something: that she is amenable to sex. I don\\'t even think that one needs to get explicit verbal consent here. I think it would be sufficient to start initiating sexually and see if she responds and take her response as consent. I think it\\'s fair to say that she\\'s consented to at least being propositioned, whether verbally or nonverbally,',\n",

It\\'s a false statement.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve created over 600,000 jobs already over a very short period of time and it\\'s going to really start catching on now,\" Trump said Tuesday at the White House, flanked by his top advisers and the CEOs who are members of his Business Advisory Council.\\n\\nHe repeated the statement later at a press conference: \"Already we\\'ve created more than almost [sic] 600,000 jobs.\"\\n\\nOfficial government data does not back up that claim.\\n\\nAccording to CNNMoney\\'s Trump Jobs Tracker, 317,000 jobs have been created since Trump took office. The president is trying to take credit for nearly double that number of jobs.\\n\\nThe ultimate authority on how many jobs are created (or lost) each month is the US Labor Department. CNNMoney\\'s 317,000 figure includes how many jobs the Labor Department reported were created in February (219,000) and March (98,000).\\n\\nA White House spokesman said Trump is including all the job added in January as well (216,000). Trump was only in office for 11.5 days that month.\\n\\nBut even if you give him all of the gains for January, that still only brings the tally to 533,000 jobs created so far in 2017.\\n\\nThe math doesn\\'t quite add up to 600,000.\\n\\nRelated: Check the data yourself with The CNNMoney Trump Jobs Tracker\\n\\nTrump likes to count job promises\\n\\nThere\\'s ongoing debate over whether a president should take credit for creating jobs at all. Most of the hiring is done by the private sector. But there\\'s a case to be made that government policies on taxes, regulations, trade, etc. do influence whether businesses want to hire or not.\\n\\n\"The president\\'s comments touting the administration\\'s economic record accurately reflect the growing optimism about his policies and the future outlook for the country,\" a White House spokesman told CNNMoney.\\n\\nTrump has frequently said he\\'s influenced companies like Ford, Charter Communications, General Motors and ExxonMobil to hire more workers, even though some of the businesses themselves refuse to give Trump credit for their hiring decisions.\\n\\nThen there\\'s the fact that some of the jobs these companies are touting as new hires are part of projects that were in the works long before Trump was elected. (CNNMoney has a running fact check of these announcements here).\\n\\nRelated: U.S. unemployment drops to 4.5%, lowest in decade\\n\\nTrump vs. Obama\\n\\nThe bottom line is: Yes, business and consumer optimism has picked up since Trump won the election. That is likely a factor in some hiring decisions by businesses. But the reality is the economy has added an average of 178,000 jobs a month so far this year. That\\'s very close to, and even slightly lower than, the average last year (187,000 a month) when President Obama was in office.',\n",

And whether you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail out with friends, watching your carbohydrate intake doesn't necessarily mean your indulging needs to come to a full stop. There are many low-carb options out there for dieters who like to drink. As with everything, moderation is key. Heavy drinking isn't good for anyone, but having a few carb-conscious cocktails here and there won't hurt. This is especially true when you consider that some of the drinks that made our top 10 list are 100 percent carb-free!\\n\\nWhy so much liquor? When it comes to low-carb alcohol, distilled spirits are the safest bet. They're virtually all free of carbohydrates, so you only need to worry about what you're mixing them with. But not everyone likes drinking hard liquor, so we've included some dieter-friendly beers and wines, too.\\n\\nDiet Jack and Coke Obviously, a regular cola would shatter your daily carbohydrate allowance.

Then pour over ice. estimated calories: 110\\n\\nestimated carbohydrates: 1.5 grams\\n\\nMichelob ULTRA Beer doesn't typically make it onto low-carb lists because most kinds are loaded with carbohydrates. Some light beers, however, won't hurt your efforts too much, including Michelob ULTRA. estimated calories: 95\\n\\nestimated carbohydrates: 2.6 grams\\n\\nWine Remember, a single glass of wine is about 5 ounces.

       " 'Hydra Slayer 18.0\\nHydra Slayer 18.0 is released on Steam and itch.io ! Hydra Slayer is a roguelike with a unique combat system, based on old matematical puzzles. The highlights of release 18.0 are the following: A new player race, the Atlanteans . Most characters in Hydra Slayer would meet vulture hydras, who grow one head for every wound they deal to the player. The Atlanteans have been cursed by the gods, and this will happen for all hydras. Will you be able to turn your curse into an advantage? The curse significantly affects the equipment and strategies to use, especially in the first 12 levels. Thanks for Patashu and Nick for the idea! Evolving hydras . They start to appear after level 25. Their resistance to the given weapon material is increased by one after each attack. These are inspired by a (slightly trollish) post by IchigoMait. Previously, each level below Level 12 contained just one special hydra (not counting bloody or dragon variants of standard colors) -- since there are 9 types, some of them will appear just a few times. The new version changes this -- some levels will replace one of the standard ones with another special, and some will almost lack normal hydras and include most of the special types instead. Challenge levels now tend to have two special hydras per level too. One new exotic weapon -- I will leave that for the players to find :) New special graphics for scythes (Atlanteans start with a scythe), hecatoncheires and monkeys. Thanks to tehora for requesting these! Removed some exploits. It is no longer possible to enhance the titanic club easily with the Reforging+Ambidexterity combo (thanks to vo3435 for abusing this). A tighter limit is placed on using time-daggers on mushrooms. Some features have been added to help with \"head draining\" attacks (all hydras for Atlanteans, Vultures for all characters). When fighting head-draining hydras, the number of wounds caused by the hydra\\'s next attack is given in the UI. For other hydras, when you select your shield, \"+1\" is displayed for the hydra whose damage is reduced by your shield.

       " 'Here Is The Best Ruleset For Ultimate: Fouling Out, Stall Clock, And No More Picks\\n\\nI watch a lot of ultimate: college, club, AUDL, MLU, you name it. I\\'ve decided on what I think is the optimal ruleset for ultimate, combining a mish-mash of rules that already exist (this is built, like every rule book, on at least 80% of the existing USAU rules) and a few things that haven\\'t been tried. This is the framework for rules at the highest level of the sport, and many of the features are only feasible for the most important games and tournaments.\\n\\nThe Field\\n\\nThe USA Ultimate rules have the field shape right. The real key is the width — 40 yards wide seems just right. It\\'s wide enough so that the offense can change angles, but not so wide that stopping breaks and swings is impossible, as it is in the semi-pro leagues.\\n\\nProponents of the football-sized field at the pro level laud the benefit of more hucking and more offense, calling it more exciting. I think that sells the spectator public short. You need a balance in every sport between offense and defense — I like watching offense-only street basketball occasionally, but I would never encourage the NBA to adopt that style. Beautiful defense — both individual and team — can be as exciting as beautiful offense, especially for the intermediate or advanced fan.\\n\\nThe Stall\\n\\nHaving players count to ten on the mark is obviously not the optimal way to track the stall count. It is way too inconsistent and is one of the most hotly contested calls in the game (\"I said the T of ten!\")\\n\\nBut the way the pro leagues solve it — with referees counting silently and inconsistently — is not great either.\\n\\nThe solution: a 7-second stall clock, visible to players and fans alike, operated on the sideline. A buzzer goes off if it hits zero. Disc still in the hand of the player? Turnover. A stall clock operator on the sideline presses a button to reset the clock when the disc is thrown/caught.\\n\\nThis would be a much more consistent and exciting way to watch a stall count unfold.\\n\\nOfficiating\\n\\nIf you\\'re coming here hoping for a firm stance on whether we should adopt observers or referees, you will be disappointed. From a spectator point of view, I simply don\\'t think it matters all that much. Players seem split on what they prefer.\\n\\nReally, the key is to have a trained professional as the official. Whether they are making active rulings or waiting for player calls before adjudicating, there are way, way too many bad officials in ultimate right now. On the whole, the officiating is particularly bad in the AUDL, where each team slaps together a crew of local refs for each game. Like many things in the AUDL, your mileage may vary. Some cities have great refs; others, not so much. I can\\'t believe how often you see a player throw his hands up for a foul call, then get it 3-4 seconds after the play happens.\\n\\nThe MLU\\'s refs are not always great, either, but they are certainly more consistent.\\n\\nThere are some very capable observers in the USAU game, and the top tier of observers are the best trained officials in the sport. We need more of them: people who aren\\'t afraid to make a call, who manage the physicality and call infractions when necessary, and who know the rules inside and out.\\n\\nRegardless, I am thoroughly convinced that top level ultimate should have officials; pure self-officiation has far too many pitfalls, especially for spectator ultimate.\\n\\nFouls\\n\\nI think the current USA Ultimate rulebook does a great job of outlining fouls. You can\\'t bump the thrower. You can\\'t slash the arms of a receiver or hold them down as they try to jump. Physicality and contact in the stack is technically disallowed, but is often uncalled by players, observers, and referees alike. The rules seem to have found the sweet spot for a \"non-contact\" sport.\\n\\nUnfortunately, enforcement leaves a lot to be desired; it\\'s probably the most glaring weakness in the current ruleset. The pro leagues have made an effort to combat fouls with a short yardage penalty, but a 10 yard penalty is so much less significant in ultimate than it is in football. USA Ultimate rules often allow players to get away with repeated, egregious fouls with almost no repercussions. The current TMF/PMF system still lacks teeth, especially when being wielded by inexperienced or timid observers.\\n\\nIt\\'s time to try a new approach. It would be easy to institute an individual foul limit on players in officiated games. Without in-game testing, it would be hard to know what the \\'foul out\\' number should be, but it would serve as an effective way to stop continued',\n",
       " 'Stephen Colbert dropped the \"L\" word (lie) and the \"F\" word (you know) on the Trump White House on Monday night. It was the late-night comedian\\'s latest blast of politically charged commentary — primarily directed at the 45th president. And it was the kind of performance that just a short time ago seemed to risk alienating large numbers of potential viewers but now appears to be making the \"Late Show\" host a very big draw.\\n\\nColbert lampooned White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who on his tour of the Sunday political talk shows asserted that \"the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.\"\\n\\n\"Will not be questioned? Let me test that theory,\" Colbert said. \"What the f--- are you talking about?\"\\n\\nColbert then challenged Miller, who said he is \"prepared to go on any show, anytime, anywhere,\" to appear on Tuesday\\'s \"Late Show.\"\\n\\n\"Listen, if you don\\'t show up, I\\'m going to call you a liar,\" Colbert said. \"And if you do show up, I\\'m going to call you a liar to your face.\"\\n\\nMiller did not show.\\n\\nWith forceful remarks like this, Colbert has been gaining on late-night king Jimmy Fallon, who is far less inclined to take on the president in a harsh manner.\\n\\nConventional wisdom is that Fallon\\'s approach works best on a major broadcast network. When the Hollywood Reporter commissioned a survey of late-night viewers in the fall of 2015, shortly after Colbert\\'s debut on CBS, it found that Fallon appealed to people across the political spectrum. The \"Tonight Show\" host\\'s audience was 36 percent Democrat, 31 percent Republican and 27 percent independent.\\n\\nColbert\\'s audience skewed sharply to the left: 47 percent Democrat, 17 percent Republican and 31 percent independent.\\n\\nA liberal slant helped make Colbert a star on Comedy Central, but \"CBS executives made it clear that they expected Mr. Colbert to broaden his appeal when he moved to the medium of late night on a network,\" the New York Times reported at the time of his hiring.\\n\\nColbert, however, was among Trump\\'s fiercest critics during the campaign and never really moderated his politics. Ratings throughout his first year on the \"Late Show\" were underwhelming, much to the delight of conservative publications such as the Weekly Standard, which in May called Colbert\\'s early struggles \"sweet schadenfreude.\"\\n\\nFormer Daily Show host Stephen Colbert weighed in on the presidency of Donald Trump during an interview with CBS News\\' Face the Nation on Dec. 25, 2016. (Reuters)\\n\\nAbsent another survey of late-night audiences, it is unclear what exactly has reversed Colbert\\'s fortunes. Are liberal viewers tuning in in greater numbers? Or is Colbert bringing in conservatives who were uncomfortable with Trump during the campaign and who feel unnerved by his fledgling administration?\\n\\nIt is worth noting that Colbert\\'s skewering of Miller on Monday night had little to do with liberal or conservative policy ideas; it was about a claim to unchecked power, which could alarm anybody.\\n\\nWe\\'ll see whether Colbert can sustain his recent success. But if he was waiting for ratings to catch up to his vision for the \"Late Show,\" his patience is being rewarded, for now.',\n",

       " 'Clinton: His role in Northern Ireland\\n\\n\\nShortly before Bill Clinton left office, BBC News Online\\'s Dominic Casciani examined his role in the peace process. It\\'s a mark of the people skills of President Bill Clinton that it took his visit to unite the people of Northern Ireland, no matter how briefly, in their tens of thousands on the streets of Belfast and Londonderry.\\n\\nWe came here knowing that words are not very good at a time like this, simply to express our sympathy and to support your determined refusal to let a cowardly crime rob you of the future\\n\\nPresident Clinton at Omagh, 1998 President Bill Clinton\\'s domestic legacy, belittled by opponents and tainted by impeachment, will be picked over for years to come. But few doubt the importance of the role that he played in helping to get Northern Ireland\\'s divided community to sit down together with the common goal of consigning violence and inequality to the past. President Clinton is now on his third visit to Dublin and Belfast - three visits more than any other serving US President has ever undertaken. It\\'s a commitment that has ranged from granting Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams a US visa in the belief that it would further peace, to admitting to being left \"overwhelmed\" following a meeting with victims of the Omagh bomb. Although the peace process is by no means complete, the White House has regarded it as little short of a Clinton foreign policy triumph. Origins of involvement For years, any White House desire to get involved in Northern Ireland was tempered by the relationship with London. Clinton timeline 1992: Irish Forum pledges 1994: Gerry Adams Visa 1994: George Mitchell Appointed 1995: First visit 1998: Key role in Good Friday Agreement 1998: Second visit 2000: Farewell visit During his White House campaign in 1992, the then Governor Clinton of Arkansas made a pledge to send a peace envoy, something that the majority of the politically influential Irish-American caucus had long sought. The commitment risked infuriating London and following election, Clinton appeared to have dropped the pledge - appointing only an \"economic envoy\", Senator George Mitchell. Coupled with the new US ambassador to Dublin, Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of Clinton\\'s hero President John F Kennedy, the two appointments began a process that would see the US strengthen its involvement in the emerging peace process. Treading a fine line Clinton\\'s approach to Northern Ireland appeared to mirror that of many of his domestic policies - appeal to all sides and seek consensus. His second policy plank was to encourage US companies to bring much-needed economic investment to Northern Ireland. But it was a fine line to follow. In 1994, President Clinton angered London, the US\\'s closest ally, by granting a US visa to Gerry Adams. Despite accusations of being soft on terrorism and opposition among some of his own people, Clinton saw it another way. Only by including the republicans could they be encouraged to leave violence behind. First visit President Clinton\\'s first visit to Northern Ireland came in November 1995, 15 months after the IRA announced its first cease-fire.\\n\\nHe was greeted by tens of thousands of people lining the streets. After famously shaking hands with Gerry Adams on Belfast\\'s Falls Road (the exact location now features in the official Belfast bus tour), he went on to receive a rapturous reception when he turned on the Christmas tree lights in Belfast city centre. Clinton appeared to fire the imagination of many people in Northern Ireland, appearing both statesmanlike, non-partisan and folksy at the same time. The Adams handshake may have drawn unionist criticism, but the president treated him no differently to the political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries - he would back those he saw as leaving violence behind. From talks to agreement George Mitchell\\'s subsequent appointment as the honest broker between all sides in the developing talks, the de facto peace envoy Clinton had promised in 1992, is regarded by many as the president\\'s single most important foreign policy decision of his administration.\\n\\nIt not only provided a respected and impartial figure to chair talks, but it effectively guaranteed the White House\\'s involvement in helping to find a political settlement in Northern Ireland, between the north and the south and Dublin and London. Throughout the 1998 talks, there were frequent telephone calls from the Oval Office to the main players - culminating in a round of late-night contacts in the days leading up to the deadline. Mr Clinton never saw his role as a guarantor of a deal - but it was certainly his intention to be an enabler, encouraging compromise and exerting pressure at the same time. Mr Clinton\\'s second visit to Northern Ireland, following the dissident republican bombing of Omagh, came as the president was facing increasing domestic pressures at home. He appeared visibly moved following a meeting with some of those who survived the bombing - but stressed to all of Northern Ireland that it was \"up to you\" to find the solutions. Difficult, sometimes wrenching decisions lie ahead but they must be made,\" he said. \"The spirit of reconciliation must be rooted in all you do.\" The future A question mark now hangs over future American policy. No',\n",
       " 'Ten years ago a visionary named Vinod Khosla gave a presentation called Biofuels: Think Outside the Barrel. It seems to have disappeared from his Khosla Ventures website, but you can find an archived version here. In that presentation Mr. Khosla outlined his vision for biofuels. He projected that ethanol produced from biomass – aka \"cellulosic ethanol\" – would scale up rapidly. From zero commercial production in 2006, Khosla foresaw the first 100 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol hitting the market in 2008 (see Slide 78), ramping rapidly to 2.5 billion gallons in 2011, 14.6 billion gallons in 2015, and ultimately 173 billion gallons per year by 2030. Combined with corn ethanol production, he believed cellulosic ethanol could totally end U.S. dependence on petroleum for transportation fuel – but he needed to get the government on board to foot some costs.\\n\\nKhosla addressed potential obstacles in his presentation. Certainly cellulosic ethanol wouldn\\'t fail because of technology. There were too many companies working on it. The magic of Moore\\'s Law and black swans would be the ticket to success. (As an aside, he doesn\\'t seem to understand the black swan theory, as he frequently cites these \"high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events\" as an expected outcome). The only real barrier he could identify was those despicable oil companies, who had to be shaking in their boots that this 100-year old upstart technology would spell their demise.\\n\\nBut he would deal with the oil companies through legislation by forcing them to purchase this product that had yet to be commercialized. So he lobbied, and he testified before Congress. He lost a vote or two, but he was instrumental in getting cellulosic ethanol mandates included in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The EPA was charged with implementing the RFS, and they based the mandated volumes on the amount that potential cellulosic ethanol producers claimed they would be able to produce. For 2010 the EPA was counting on 100 million gallons of cellulosic fuels based on claims primarily from two companies associated with Vinod Khosla: Range Fuels and Cello Energy.\\n\\nThis is ground that has been amply covered here before. Range Fuels and Cello Energy both went out of business after spending hundreds of millions of dollars — including taxpayer money — without delivering a drop of cellulosic fuel. In fact there were zero gallons of qualifying cellulosic ethanol production for 2010 and 2011. In 2012 the first qualifying batch of cellulosic ethanol was produced — 20,069 gallons by Blue Sugars Corporation. The ethanol was produced in April 2012, but that was it for the year. And Blue Sugars went out of business.\\n\\nThere was no qualifying cellulosic ethanol produced in 2013, the year Vinod Khosla had projected 7.2 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol production. But 2014 finally saw some qualifying production as several new plants came online.\\n\\nINEOS Bio and its joint venture partner New Planet Energy had announced the opening of the Indian River County BioEnergy Center in Florida in 2012. The nameplate capacity of this plant was 8 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year. The House Committee on Agriculture was told in 2012 \"The biorefinery is a major landmark for this country. It\\'s the first commercial cellulosic refinery.\" But the EPA doesn\\'t show any production from anyone in 2012 or 2013, and in December 2013 the company issued a press release that said in part: \"Bringing the facility on-line and up to capacity has taken longer than planned due to several unexpected start-up issues at the Center. These efforts have highlighted some needed modifications and upgrades.\" Another update from them in 2014 cast doubt that they would ever produce any ethanol.\\n\\nOn July 7, 2011 the U.S. Department of Energy had announced a $105 million loan guarantee to POET for the development of its 25 million gallon per year corn cob-to-ethanol facility, dubbed Project Liberty, at Emmetsberg, Iowa. POET, one of the largest producers of ethanol in the world announced that they were open for commercial cellulosic ethanol production in September 2014. Cellulosic ethanol production had been slated to begin in May 2013, but more than a year later than projected Jeff Broin, POET Founder and Executive Chairman, stated \"Some have called cellulosic ethanol a \\'fantasy fuel,\\' but today it becomes a reality.\"\\n\\nAnother company, Abengoa (NASDAQ: ABGB) built a $500 million cellulosic ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kansas. In October 2014 they announced the grand opening of the facility: \"Abengoa\\'s new industry-leading biorefinery finished construction in mid-August and began producing cellulosic ethanol at the end of September with the capacity to produce up to 25 million gallons per year.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Long and confusing title, I know, but I\\'m desperate for help and advice. I\\'m full of anger and stress at the same time but I don\\'t know what to do. I\\'m hormonal and can\\'t think clearly and am honestly furious and scared that our marriage is going to fall apart. The abuse happened two years ago which is why I\\'m posting here but the problem is happening now. We\\'ve been married since Valentine\\'s Day 2014.\\n\\nIn 2015, my husband Manuel finished his Navy reserves enlistment. He has a very high paying career and about a week after being discharged, he went to his friend\\'s party. Basically at the party, a woman named Emma started talking to him, drugged his drink, and took advantage of him. My husband found out the day after because a friend told him he found him unconscious and saw earlier Emma on top of him on the bed but didn\\'t realize it was him until later. Manuel didn\\'t report her because he didn\\'t want to \"ruin her life\" and so the law never got involved. My husband told me what happened the day after the party and I had a mental breakdown and went to therapy because I was going to legitimately kill her. To make it worse, she got pregnant from the incident. I don\\'t have violent thoughts anymore but at the time I was so angry that I wanted to kill her and it got worse once I found out she got pregnant from that. I felt so bad for Manuel and he was disappointed at how he was taken advantage of but it didn\\'t seem to affect him that much. I don\\'t know if it was because he didn\\'t want to show emotion or if it really didn\\'t affect him.\\n\\nHe helps her out willingly and pays for some of her expenses and their baby\\'s expenses. She\\'s a pharmacy technician but since rent in our state and city is pretty high, he helps her out. He went to her delivery and even though he\\'s extremely busy with work and our time, she drops their baby off at our apartment a lot of times in the evening since I don\\'t allow my husband to be alone with her at all or go to her apartment and so my husband can spend time with him. I have met her but we have spoken maybe 40 words total and we\\'re extremely cold and distant. The only reason I\\'m even letting this happen is because it\\'s not the baby\\'s fault and I don\\'t want Manuel to not see his baby.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Emma came to our apartment and wanted to talk to my husband. They sat down, she wanted me to leave the room to talk in private but I told her no right off the bat because I don\\'t trust her. She legitimately told him that he needed to \"step up\" and \"be a more active father\" and \"be there for our baby\". She works full time and her parents help out with the babysitting .\\n\\nShe wants their baby to spend more time with both of them together instead of just her \"dropping him off like a package\" and not having the baby bond with both parents at the same time. She said that Manuel also needed to be available more often since she wants Manuel to be around the baby and she wants to drop the baby off more times a week (right now it\\'s around 2-4 times per week...the baby sometimes spends the night but mostly she comes picks him up after a few hours). She needs money for a car since her car is breaking down and she \"doesn\\'t want any problems with dropping the baby off or endangering the baby\". This sounds like a load of shit to me but I want opinions. She wants Manuel to make trips to her apartment and visit the baby because sometimes she can\\'t make the trip. In my opinion, if worse comes to worse, I\\'ll drive and pick up the baby but I\\'m starting to think she might want to take advantage of him again since she desperately wants him to go to her apartment to visit their baby.\\n\\nShe acts so shameless and her attitude was so bitchy. She was acting like Manuel was \"slacking\" or neglecting his duties like they were married or something. The part where she wanted me to leave the room made me extremely suspicious and I\\'m wondering if maybe she wants to tell him something else but didn\\'t because I was there. I\\'m pregnant and when the baby comes and we have more, I obviously expect Manuel to prioritize his real children and not her or her baby.\\n\\nShe left after a while and honestly she comes off as flirty sometimes but I don\\'t mind since they barely see each other and he\\'d never do anything with her. He\\'s very nice to her but keeps his distance with her like I want him to.\\n\\nI told him that absolutely not is he going to buy her a new car. He started telling me that he\\'s going to pay for a safe and good car for her. She has money and she isn\\'t poor. Manuel is saying that he doesn\\'t want his baby to have a low quality car',\n",

       " 'John Amos is one of those actors fortunate enough to have more than one iconic role on his résumé. His two biggest parts were as patriarch James Evans Sr. on Good Times and as the elder Kunta Kinte on Roots. But he first won fame with a smaller, yet still enduring, part: Gordy the weatherman on CBS\\'s The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Amos appeared roughly a dozen times over the course of the show\\'s first three seasons, and even though he left to take a regular gig on Good Times in 1974, his character was vital enough that he returned with his own spotlight episode during the final season of Mary Tyler Moore. Tonight Amos can be seen talking about his experiences on the show, alongside Betty White, Valerie Harper, Ed Asner, Dick Van Dyke, and others, as part of Mary Tyler Moore: A Celebration, airing at 8 p.m. on most PBS stations. Vulture caught up with Amos by phone last week to dive deeper into his MTM days, including how the show gave him his big break as an actor and the time producers had to retaliate against a racist crew member. He also talked to us about his bumpy ride on Good Times and gave us his thoughts about next year\\'s planned update of Roots.\\n\\nIt\\'s great to speak to you, Mr. Amos. You\\'re on the East Coast now, right? How are you?\\n\\nI\\'m in Jersey. I\\'m fine!\\n\\nI want to talk to you first about The Mary Tyler Moore Show, since you\\'re part of this new PBS tribute to Ms. Moore. Your role on MTM was sort of your first big national exposure as an actor, though you\\'d worked as a writer for Leslie Uggams\\'s CBS variety show back in 1969. I read an interview with you where you talked about how you had wanted to break into performing on her show, but the producers said you couldn\\'t do both. Why was that?\\n\\nBack then you were lucky to be in the business in any working capacity. The idea that I would be in there as a writer, and then want to perform, too? That was just an abstract concept to the producers at that time. They weren\\'t ready for somebody who thought they could act and write. I had to wait until my turn came.\\n\\nWhen you say they weren\\'t ready, was it because you were young, or because you were African-American?\\n\\nI think it was a bit of both. I was just getting started, and that was my first network writing job. Although I had written comedy and performed on a local television show, Lohman & Barkley, which won an Emmy. In fact, we all wrote and performed, the \"we\" being the entire writing staff, which consisted of Craig T. Nelson, Barry Levinson, the late McLean Stevenson, amongst others. We were all just getting started, and that was wonderful training for us. Having written and performed on a local show that did successfully, I had every reason to believe I could do that at the network level. But they said, \"No, you can only do one.\"\\n\\nSo how did you ultimately make the jump to performing, and to MTM?\\n\\nOne day I had lunch with two of the writers on the [Uggams] show, Lorenzo Music and Dave Davis. And they said, \"John, when you act out these sketches for our guest artists, we think you\\'ve got the chops. We\\'re involved in the development of something called The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and we think you\\'d be right for one of the characters.\" I just took it with a grain of salt. It sounded too good to be true. But later they stayed true to their word. When The Mary Tyler Moore Show [was picked up to series], they called me.\\n\\nDid you have to try out for the gig?\\n\\nI auditioned for Mary, Grant Tinker, and the powers that be, and got the job as Gordy the weatherman. It became a recurring character.\\n\\nBecause of The Dick Van Dyke Show, Ms. Moore was already a TV icon of sorts even before she got her own series. What was your experience working with her?\\n\\nThe joy of working with Mary was, you knew who the star of the show was. It was The Mary Tyler Moore Show. So there were no attempts to upstage her, or any of the other things that usually go with actors surrounding the star. It was a harmonious set. She and Phyllis and Valerie got along great, because all they would talk about, all day long, was diets and health food. [Laughs.] As soon as they got to the set, the conversation would start.

Edit\\n\\nOn my current (and thus far first) playthrough, I had two options for springing Blackwall from prison. The first was \"Thom Rainier\\'s Fate\", which appears to be the default option. I also had the opportunity to send Leliana in to extract him without implicating the Inquisition via the operation \"Rainier\\'s Release: An Alternative\".\\n\\nMy sister, however, did not have the secondary option. Anyone have an idea? I play a female Qunari rogue with the Underworld Knowledge Inquisition Perk, and she is a female human warrior without it, so I suspect the difference may lie there.

       " 'It is a slider/cutter, a pitch that has been called a \"slutter\" by some and simply an expletive by others, mainly those trying to hit it.\\n\\nBut it also has been one key to the ridiculous success of Cubs stud right-hander Jake Arrieta, who faces the Mets in Game 2 of the NLCS Sunday at Citi Field.\\n\\n\"It\\'s developed over the course of several years,\" Arrieta said Saturday before his Cubs fell 4-2 in Game 1. \"The consistency mechanically is really where that pitch started to flourish, being able to repeat the same delivery, same arm slot on a pretty regular basis. Adjusting the velocity by tweaking the release point is really where the change in speed comes from.\\n\\n\"That\\'s why you\\'ll hear it called a slider or a cutter based on different sequences to different hitters.\"\\n\\nOr, of course, a few unprintable words.\\n\\nRegardless, it is part of the reason Arrieta, who finished 22-6 with a 1.77 ERA, is favored to take home the Cy Young Award. Not bad for the former Oriole — he was traded in 2013 with Pedro Strop for Scott Feldman and Steve Clevenger, sort of the gods\\' way of evening out Milt Pappas for Frank Robinson.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just been some hard work and some repetition,\" Arrieta, 29, said of his pitch, noting his transformation from regular pitcher to All-Star began the day he joined the Cubs.\\n\\n\"[I] reverted back to some things that I was doing successfully, and I started to do those more often … comfort things that I had in place,\" Arrieta said. \"My arm slot, my release point became more consistent over time, and the confidence continued to rise.\"\\n\\nIt rose to where Arrieta had a season that recalls the day of Bob Gibson.\\n\\nAccording to Elias Sports Bureau, he is just the fifth pitcher with at least 22 wins with a sub-2.00 ERA since ERA became an official stat before World War I (1912 in the NL, 1913 in the AL). Arrieta posted a ridiculous 0.75 ERA and was 12-1 with two shutouts in the second half, the best numbers since the All-Star Game began in 1933. And from Aug. 4 to the end of the season, he was 11-0 with a 0.41 ERA, the best numbers ever.\\n\\nYeah, but he did walk 14 guys in that stretch…\\n\\nManager Joe Maddon sees something different behind Arrieta\\'s rise.\\n\\n\"Biggest, biggest difference is fastball command, period. He knows where his fastball\\'s going,\" Maddon said.\\n\\nMets manager Terry Collins just pointed to the total package.\\n\\n\"His location has just been off the charts,\" Collins said. \"He\\'s got this, he may call it a slider, it\\'s this hard cutter that he\\'s now started to command that he\\'s eating up left-handed hitters. He locates the fastball. He moves his curveball around.\"\\n\\nArrieta threw a career high 229 innings, but Maddon noted how much of his work was low stress because he only averaged 15-plus pitches an inning. Arrieta claimed the mental was harder than the physical.\\n\\n\"The mental expenditure of energy,\" Arrieta assessed. \"Throughout the course of the day you start to contemplate your routine and think about the game in different scenarios … that heart rate starts to rise a little bit.\"\\n\\nThink of the guys facing him.\\n\\n\"The physical toll really hasn\\'t bothered me at all,\" he said, \"but the mental side of it and all the energy you burn leading up to the game does have a little bit of effect.\"',\n",

The car is very sentimental to me and Tri-Point has been amazing. They\\'ve taken meticulous care in their repairs. I\\'ve been driving the car to work and loving it. Thank you, Tri-Point Engineering\\n\\nTook my 09 Mazdaspeed 3 in to get serviced by these self proclaimed Mazda specialist, what I ended up receiving is ham-fisted, half-ass work, with 0 accountability resulting in me needing to pay another shop to fix mistakes. Services I paid for that were performed improperly: - Replaced gas cap to try and resolve Vacuum code After I took the car to get er filled up, I noticed that the gas cap that they replaced my OEM one with did not spin properly with the rubber-gasket-string that attaches it to the exterior door. Basically, you\\'d turn it tight and it\\'d rip out the rubber-gasket-string from the gas door. Obviously an inadequate gas cap was ordered as it did not fit with the factory equipment. But the worse offense was that they installed it, and I\\'m assuming tested it, and found it\\'s improper fitment as passable. This is just a microcosm of the lack of attention to detail, and or pride in the work they do. I immediately took it back and they ended up shaving the rubber gasket down so it\\'d spin with the gas cap. I\\'m still experiencing the vacuum leak so this was also a misdiagnosis. -Motor-mount replacement Paid $500 to have my engine motor mount replaced (was experiencing no issues at the time but took their word for it). Well, 9k miles later, I started to hear creeks, and clacks coming from the engine bay. Turns out the motor mount they replaced was totally shot. Ended up paying $600 to have them all replaced to resolve the issue. -Replaced spark plugs Immediately after the performed the work my car would no longer start in cold weather. They insisted it had nothing to do with the work they performed but the problem only started happening after the work they performed. Well, 9k miles later, I started experiencing really rough idle. I looked on the forums and a common cause is spark plugs not being gapped properly. I took them out myself, re-gapped them to .029, and now the problem is gone. A couple were off by quite a few centimeters. What kind of shop can\\'t gap their spark plugs properly? Other notes: It was really difficult getting ahold of them during the whole time they had my car. They don\\'t work weekends and during the week when I\\'d call them I\\'d never get a call back for days at a time. I tried emailing them but even that it\\'d take forever to receive a message back.\\n\\nThe real-deal Tri-Point is long gone. Do yourself a favor and avoid these imposters. The real Tri-Point worked on my ancient Mazda 626 and later my 1991 RX-7 GTUs. That shop is long gone. Marc Shuler and Craig Nagler (the REAL owners) were certified card carrying Mazda experts. The current owners aren\\'t really even up to the challenge of operating. Their location looks like a wrecking yard and they rarely answer the phone. Still, I took a chance and made an \"appointment\" with them for an oil change. I showed up at the shop at the designated time but no one was there. To be honest, it looked they were out of business and left a bunch of partially repaired cars in their wake. I walked around and finally the guy in the shop next door called over to me and said, \"He\\'s not here.\" Uh, right; \"he\" is most obviously not here... So, I stood around for a while and then headed for home. I figured that a few minutes later I\\'d get a call from them explaining what was going on. Nope. Silence. After I got home I decided to call them just to follow-up and to thank them for wasting 45 minutes of my day. The guy I talked to sounded like he had just woken up. When I told him about my appointment and the fact he weren\\'t there he said, \"Well, you don\\'t need an appointment for an oil change.\" Amazingly clueless. I wouldn\\'t trust these guys to change my windshield wiper blades. They do not deserve to be doing business under the name Tri-Point Engineering. Avoid them at all costs.\\n\\nThis is my 1990\\' Mazda Miata the car is one of lifes joys an who better to take care of most precious possesions in life but the very guys who do what they love as a living!

A 2007 Pentagon memo that the New York Times quoted in a 2010 article says that Afghanistan could be the \"Saudi Arabia of lithium.\"\\n\\nU.S. Companies are planning on taking a larger role in extracting Afghanistan\\'s enormous reserves of valuable rare earth minerals, Reuters reported after U.S. President Donald Trump met with his Afghan counterpart Ashraf Ghani on Thursday.\\n\\nAccording to a White House statement, the presidents agreed that the development of Afghan minerals by U.S. companies would \"develop materials critical to national security,\" as well as \"defray some of the costs of United States assistance as Afghans become more self-reliant.\"\\n\\nAfghanistan has some of the world\\'s largest un-extracted reserves of rare earth minerals valuable in electronic production, such as lithium, as well as gold and various gemstones. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the total value at at least US$1 trillion.\\n\\nThe two presidents reportedly discussed difficulties facing the project, such as the growing Taliban insurgency in regions containing the majority of the minerals. With this in account, they both expressed commitment to Trump\\'s new Afghanistan strategy, which, against what he promised in the election campaign, involves keeping U.S. military forces in the country for an indefinite period of time.\\n\\nThe U.S. military has had its eyes on Afghan mineral deposits for some time. A 2007 Pentagon memo that the New York Times quoted in a 2010 article says that Afghanistan could be the \"Saudi Arabia of lithium,\" referencing the oil-rich monarchy that is a key U.S. regional ally.\\n\\n\"There is stunning potential here (in Afghanistan),\" General David Petraeus said in the same memo.\\n\\nSome analysts also believe that a push for greater U.S. presence in Afghan mineral extraction could be a way of limiting the influence of China. With China, along with Russia and Iran gaining greater regional influence, economic activities in the region are no longer the sole domain of U.S.-based companies.\\n\\nChina and Afghanistan have already cooperated to an extent in mineral extraction and China has made the country a center-point of its planned Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to commercially link Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and more recently Latin America and the Caribbean.\\n\\nAfghanistan also has extensive oil reserves, with a new oil field having been discovered as recently as 2010.\\n\\nWritten by TeleSUR\\n\\nEditor\\'s Note: This natural resource extraction was one of the original ambitions of those who disingenuously led the US to war in Afghanistan under the guise of fighting a \"war on terror,\" that better resembles a war OF terror, much like has been seen in any country the US \"liberates.\" And in classically contradictory deep state fashion, this is being framed ironically as a way to \\'defray cost of assistance.\\' So after Afghanistan is left in ruin, with more \"terrorist\" presence than to begin with, otherwise known as US \"assistance,\" the US is now going to begin mining (more of) the country\\'s natural resources, in exchange for that \"assistance.\" Long ago, this country was usurped by individuals who now deceptively carry out this type of atrocity in your name, while invoking and stoking your blind patriotism at every turn.

       " '(CNN) Almost 6 in 10 Americans have a favorable opinion about Joe Biden in a new CNN national poll , a finding sure to give the Democratic former vice president a boost as he considers whether to run for president in 2020.\\n\\nThe 57% favorable rating is Biden\\'s best in CNN polling since February 2009 -- when he was sworn in as Barack Obama\\'s vice president. Just over 1 in 4 (27%) have an unfavorable view of Biden.\\n\\nWhat\\'s remarkable about those numbers is how Biden\\'s favorability has surged since he (and Obama) left office. As recently as March 2015, CNN polling showed more people viewed Biden unfavorably (46%) than regarded him favorably (43%).\\n\\nThe recovery of Biden\\'s numbers stands in stark contrast to the ongoing negative view that Americans hold of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party\\'s 2016 presidential nominee; in Gallup polling released earlier this week, Clinton\\'s favorable rating dipped to 36%\\n\\nWhat explains Biden\\'s current popularity? A few things:\\n\\nHe drew hugely laudatory coverage earlier this year for his book tour in support of his memoir about the loss of his eldest son, Beau.\\n\\nPoliticians -- with the notable exception of Clinton (of late) -- always grow more popular when out of office.\\n\\nSome level of buyer\\'s remorse -- particularly among Democrats -- who believe that had Biden run in 2016, he would have easily beaten Donald Trump.\\n\\nBiden has been open about his thinking on running for president in 2020, which would be his third bid for the nation\\'s highest office. \"If I were offered the nomination by the Lord Almighty right now, today, I would say no because we\\'re not ready, the family\\'s not ready to do this,\" Biden said on \"The View\" earlier this month. \"If, in a year from now, if we\\'re ready, and nobody has moved in that I think can do it, then I may very well do it.\"\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Biden won\\'t deny a 2020 run for president Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden won\\'t deny a 2020 run for president 01:21\\n\\nWhile Biden has made no decisions, he\\'s doing the sorts of things someone running for president does in these early stages. He has apologized for his less-than-robust defense of Anita Hill during Clarence Thomas\\' Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1991. He has traveled the country in support of Democratic candidates. And so on.\\n\\nWhat\\'s so interesting about the CNN poll is that it not only shows why Biden is clearly a top-tier candidate if he runs for president but it also reveals his potential Achilles\\' heel in that race.\\n\\nWhen asked whether \"the country would be governed better or governed worse if more women were in political office,\" almost two-thirds of Americans (64%) said the country would be better off with more women in office. Just 10% said things would be worse with more women in elected office, while 16% said it wouldn\\'t make much difference.\\n\\nWhy is that relevant to Biden? Because he is a 75-year-old white man considering a run for president amid the #metoo movement and a cultural awakening about the boorish -- and in some cases criminal -- behavior by men toward women in the workplace.\\n\\nThat a large majority of people believe the country would be better off with more women running things suggests a major opening exists for a female politician to make a very credible run for the Democratic nomination in 2020.\\n\\nAt the moment, none of the female candidates who might run are even close to as well known as Biden. One example: More than half of the country -- 55% -- didn\\'t know enough about New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to offer an opinion about her in the new CNN poll\\n\\nBut, it\\'s 2017. Which means Gillibrand, who has become a leading voice of the #metoo movement in Congress, has plenty of time to get better known and to challenge the likes of Biden for the nomination.\\n\\nThat is a worry for another day for Biden and his allies, however. Today they will revel in his popularity and use those positive numbers to build buzz for a 2020 bid.',\n",

It lets us open the gift to journalists and historians that is the life of Richard M. Nixon.\\n\\nHis 1974 resignation over Watergate makes it easy today to forget that by late 1973, President Nixon was in big trouble over how little he was paying in federal taxes.\\n\\nHe himself first steered attention to his taxes by boasting at a September press conference that he\\'d been audited by the IRS and found clean. Reporters started digging and, long story short, he had paid Uncle Sam less than $6,000 on an aggregate income of $790,000 from 1970 through 1972.\\n\\nHe\\'d taken big deductions for donating his vice-presidential papers to charity and for interest on the mortgage for his San Clemente house, among other things. The public was outraged.\\n\\n\"Nixon\\'s taxes were an issue that average citizens readily understood as compared to the constitutional issues raised by the Watergate investigation,\" concluded University of Alabama tax professor William Samson, in a 2005 analysis of the returns.\\n\\nUpon further consideration, the IRS decided that Nixon owed $465,000 in back taxes, which he paid. This penalty cut Nixon\\'s personal wealth in half.\\n\\nAfter Nixon\\'s resignation, President Gerald Ford faced the task of restoring citizens\\' faith in government. The US tax system is largely voluntary, after all. Few taxpayers are audited. If voters think the person at the top is cheating, they will, too.\\n\\nSo in April 1976, at the start of his own reelection campaign, Mr. Ford publicly released his 1975 return. He\\'d paid $94,569 in taxes on an income of $204,606.

They really make the Harby player have to be very careful or she dies and make her cut down alot on her martyrdom, or she is in danger. Even with a devout the list has no shooting so the reeves are 100% safe at all times. Not to mention they are excellent against all of the \"normal\" menoth stuff. As far as the assassination goes, you can use the excess reeves to clear spots, sunder spirits etc. It takes some planning, but is really not very difficult.\\n\\n\\nI would suggest playing it again :-)\\n\\n\\nWill',\n",
       " 'A new teaser trailer for the Princess And The Frog is online, and while the hand-drawn animation is really exquisite, there are still several upsetting things about what\\'s being called Disney\\'s \"first black princess\" movie.\\n\\nAlthough the New Orleans Jazz Age and bayous make a gorgeous backdrop for this story, some of the elements in this (admittedly short) new trailer made me knit my brow. Of course, these snippets of scenes are taken out of context, and no one is expecting the film to be perfect. But after years and years of Euro-centric stories, this American tale should be told properly — without being offensive.\\n\\nHere\\'s what\\'s troubling:\\n\\nThe witch doctor\\'s \"curse\" seems to involve some kind of African-esque masks; because African people are spooky and scary and have magical powers! Or at least, that\\'s what we want young, impressionable children to think.\\n\\n\"Women like a man with a big back porch,\" says the firefly, slapping his ass.

Someone needs to get him some low-cost dental care, ASAP.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe good news is that the Princess seems smart, bold and fun — and the doll is sure to be a big seller at Christmastime, giving little black girls who wish upon a star a shot at believing dreams come true.\\n\\nClick to view\\n\\n\\'Princess and the Frog\\' Teaser Trailer @ Yahoo!

       " 'More than 70 North Carolina law enforcement agencies are using automatic license plate readers, cell phone location trackers and surveillance cameras to keep an eye, and a mass of data, on ordinary citizens. And soon, they could be able to add unmanned drones to that list.\\n\\n\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina (ACLU-NC) uncovered a wealth of information about surveillance technologies that police and sheriff\\'s departments use in jurisdictions across the state, through a series of public records requests. Thursday morning, ACLU-NC policy director Sarah Preston and staff attorney Nathan Wessler joined former state Senator and criminal defense attorney Thom Goolsby to host a legislative briefing on privacy and surveillance issues.\\n\\n\\nWhile surveillance technology is not new, its use by law enforcement is becoming more widespread in the digital age, and the laws regulating its use have fallen far behind. The federal statute that governs warrantless access to cell phone and email records, for example, has not been updated since 1986. Now, regulating surveillance technology is falling to the states, and the ACLU-NC is pushing for legislation that protects the Fourth Amendment, by requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant before collecting certain kinds of digital information on citizens.\\n\\n\\n\"Bills that have been introduced in the past have had bi-partisan support,\" Preston said. \"This is a great issue to bring forward right now to build common ground (between parties). We are really hopeful that we will see legislators move forward and we\\'re thankful that they are taking an interest in this.\"\\n\\n\\nLaw enforcement agencies can track locations electronically in two ways.\\n\\n\\nFirst, they can request historical data from a cell phone service provider, as providers log the sector of the specific cell phone tower that transmitted every phone call made and received, every text message sent and received and every time a phone is used to access data such as email or social media sites. With more and more people using smart phones, more cell phone towers are being built closer together, making law enforcement\\'s ability to locate someone GPS-level precise.\\n\\n\\nThough this practice is widespread—the ACL-NCU found that in 2014, AT&T received 30 thousand data requests from law enforcement, and that the numbers of requests are increasing monthly—it could easily be regulated by requiring police to obtain a warrant before receiving the data.\\n\\n\\nPolice can also use their own technology to track location with the purchase of Cell Site Simulators, or Stingrays, from private manufacturers. Stingrays mimic cell phone towers by sending out signals which trick every cell phone in the vicinity into reporting its unique serial number and other data. A cell phone user would have no way to tell if police were tracking their phone.\\n\\n\\nStingray use is shrouded in secrecy—the Associated Press reports that the Obama administration instructed police departments not to disclose their use of Stingrays— so it is unclear how much data law enforcement agencies obtain with these devices. But Stingrays can pinpoint an individual cell phone\\'s location down to a room in a building and law enforcement can track cell phone transmissions and record their locations over time. Regulating these devices will go beyond just having to obtain a warrant, as they gather data from not just one individual cell phone, but from all the cell phones in the vicinity.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s vital to address both historical and real time records,\" said ACLU-NC staff attorney Wessler. \"Historical records give police a power that in our entire history they have never had before, essentially a time machine that lets police go back in time and see where you have been in the course of days and weeks and months.\"\\n\\n\\nAutomatic License Plate Readers (ALPR\\'s)—cameras mounted on stoplights, buildings, police cruisers—can capture thousands of license plates per minute, scan them for red flags and store the time-stamped images indefinitely. While ALPR\\'s have many non-controversial uses, like matching tags to stolen vehicles or capturing traffic violations, their widespread use and the data they store could allow government agencies to map out a person\\'s location and movements over time, an invasion of privacy.\\n\\n\\nIn North Carolina, the ACLU-NC found that 11 jurisdictions use ALPR\\'s without any state regulation, and some agencies store the information for years, regardless of whether there is any suspicion of a crime. Simply requiring the images to be deleted after a period of ten days could be an effective way to regulate these devices.\\n\\n\\nUnmanned aircraft, or drones, could present a significant new avenue for government surveillance, according to the ACLU-NC. Law enforcement agencies across the country, including in North Carolina, have expressed interest in testing drones, and at least two jurisdictions in the state have purchased drones with surveillance equipment using drug forfeiture funds. The 2014 budget included HB 1066, a bill that ostensibly sought to regulate the use of drones by government agencies but that contained a long list of exceptions that allowed their use without a warrant.\\n\\n\\nThe ACLU-NC is lobbying to amend state law to limit the use of drones \"to instances where there are specific and artic',\n",
       " 'SEC Files Fraud Charges Against Former Restaurant Executives for Undisclosed Compensation and Accounting Fraud; Former CEO Agrees to Pay $500,000 Civil Penalty\\n\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\\n\\n2006-89\\n\\nWashington, D.C., June 7, 2006 - The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the filing of securities fraud charges against three former top officers of an operator of national restaurant chains in connection with their receipt of approximately one million dollars in undisclosed compensation, participation in undisclosed related party transactions, and financial statement fraud from 2000 to 2004. The SEC charges were filed against Buca, Inc.\\'s former CEO, Joseph Micatrotto, the company\\'s former CFO, Greg Gadel, and its former Controller, Daniel J. Skrypek.\\n\\nBuca is a Minneapolis, Minn., company that operates the Buca di Beppo and Vinny T\\'s of Boston national restaurant chains.\\n\\n\"Buca\\'s top officers created a tone at the top and a corporate culture that allowed them to loot the company and engage in a financial fraud,\" stated Linda Thomsen, the SEC\\'s Director of Enforcement. \"Such conduct is a fundamental violation of the trust placed in corporate officers by public shareholders and cannot be countenanced.\"\\n\\n\"The fraud that pervaded the executive suite at Buca existed because the company\\'s top officers showed scant regard for sound corporate governance,\" said Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the Commission\\'s Midwest Regional Office. \"The sanctions obtained against Buca\\'s former CEO, Mr. Micatrotto, demonstrate that the Commission will deal with such conduct in the strongest terms.\"\\n\\nMicatrotto has agreed to settle the Commission\\'s action, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, by consenting to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of $65,000 plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty of $500,000 and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company. In setting the disgorgement amount, the Commission took into account Micatrotto\\'s previous payments to Buca in connection with his undisclosed compensation and his transfer of title of an Italian villa to Buca.\\n\\nThe Commission\\'s complaint alleges that, from 2000 to 2003, Micatrotto obtained undisclosed compensation in the amount of $849,100 by improperly billing Buca for a wide variety of personal and non-business expenses. In a separate action, filed against Buca\\'s former CFO, Greg A. Gadel, and former Controller, Daniel J. Skrypek, the Commission alleges that Gadel and Skrypek approved many of Micatrotto\\'s inappropriate reimbursement requests.\\n\\nThe complaint against Micatrotto alleges that Buca \"reimbursed\" the former CEO for, among other things, $131,000 in cash withdrawals from ATMs; a total of $127,000 for the same airline tickets submitted for reimbursement multiple times; the entire bill for the groom\\'s dinner at his son\\'s wedding; and other personal expenses, including dog kenneling and the remodeling of his homes in California, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. However, since these payments were not made to reimburse legitimate business expenses, they constituted additional compensation to Micatrotto and should have been reflected as such on Buca\\'s books. They were not. As a result, Buca\\'s proxy statements for this time period understated Micatrotto\\'s annual compensation by amounts ranging from 27% to 74%.\\n\\nThe Commission\\'s complaint further alleges that Micatrotto engaged in two undisclosed related-party transactions. First, in 2001 Micatrotto used Buca funds to purchase an Italian villa in the name of himself and his wife, and then arranged for Buca to pay for certain improvements to the villa. Second, in June 2003 Micatrotto personally received $65,000 from one of Buca\\'s vendors. The complaint charges Micatrotto with violating, and aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, proxy, reporting, internal controls and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.\\n\\nIn its separate action against Buca\\'s former CFO, Gadel, and former Controller, Skrypek, the Commission alleges that Gadel, from 2000 to 2003, received approximately $96,630 in undisclosed compensation, including reimbursements that he obtained from Buca for family vacations and visits to strip clubs. The complaint further alleges that Gadel knew of a series of undisclosed related party transactions totaling more than $1 million between Buca and an information technology company of which Gadel was a director and shareholder. Finally, the Commission\\'s complaint alleges that Gadel and Skrypek directed a financial fraud in which Buca inflated its income by nearly $12 million from 2000 to 2004 through the improper capitalization of numerous expenses. The financial fraud caused Buca to overstate its annual income in amounts ranging from 18.8% to 36.9%. The Commission\\'s complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota',\n",

       " 'Is Binance Finally Starting to Run Low on Walton?\\n\\nHow Demand for Guardian Masternodes is Affecting Binance\\'s Token Supply\\n\\nThis post builds upon the ideas raised by Mr. Laserman\\'s great article Guardian Masternode Token Lockup, so you may want to read that article first.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to read a lot, but like data, you can get the basic narrative from this spreadsheet: Transactions on Binance\\'s Walton Wallet.\\n\\nYou can watch the Binance Walton wallet balance here.\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nOn November 27 Walton announced their Guardian Masternode program. (Guardian Masternode AMA)\\n\\nAnyone with 5000+ Walton tokens in their wallet before 7:00 PM EST on Saturday, December 9 can run a Guardian Masternode. (Countdown timer)\\n\\ncan run a Guardian Masternode. (Countdown timer) No additional Guardian Masternodes will ever be created after this deadline.\\n\\nGuardian Masternodes will receive higher mining rewards than standard masternodes.\\n\\nWATCHING THE BINANCE WALLET\\n\\nMr. Laserman\\'s Helpful Analysis\\n\\nOn November 30, Mr. L posted his article \"Guardian Masternode token lockup,\" showing why the introduction of Guardian Masternodes would cause a rapid reduction in the number of tokens available for purchase, and thereforce likely cause a price increase.\\n\\nBecause Binance is the only major exchange that currently trades Walton, Mr. Lasermen pointed out that Binance represents \"96% of all tokens kept on exchanges,\" and showed the effect that the announcement had already on Binance\\'s supply of Walton tokens:\\n\\nNovember 27th: One hour before the Guardian Masternode was announced, Binance had 3,760,193 WTC (15% of the circulating supply) in its wallet.\\n\\nNovember 30th: Binance had only 2,013,874 WTC (8% of the circulating supply) in its wallet.\\n\\n44% of all liquid tradable WTC have been removed from the marketplace in 3 days.\\n\\nMr. L then speculated that if 50% of Binance\\'s remaining Walton tokens were withdrawn during the run-up to the Guardian deadline, that would leave only 1 million tokens for sale on Binance, or about 4% of the circulating supply.\\n\\nThis drastic reduction in available supply would then affect the price accordingly:\\n\\nIf demand remains constant, I would expect a 200–300% increase in price over the next 30 days as the market tries to find a new equilibrium. This would translate to a price in the range of $10.34 to $15.51.\\n\\nIf demand increases, I would expect a 400% increase in price at a minimum. The upper bounds are impossible to predict if a FOMO event takes place. However, 1000% is entirely possible in that scenario. This would translate to a price in the range from $20.68 to $51.70.\\n\\nHow Things Have Played Out Since Then\\n\\nAs it turns out, despite his great insights, Mr. L drastically underestimated the rate at which Walton would be withdrawn from Binance.\\n\\nOn November 30, around 5:30 pm EST, he speculated that perhaps about 1 million WTC would be withdrawn over the next 10 days leading up to the deadline.\\n\\nIn fact, 1 million WTC had already been withdrawn from Binance by 8:30 pm the next day, just 27 hours later.\\n\\nPlot Twist\\n\\nBut what Mr. Laserman didn\\'t count on was that Binance was going to \"re-up\" their Walton wallet, using customer deposits from other wallet addresses.\\n\\nOn December 1 at 5:00 am, Binance added another 1.2 million in WTC to their wallet address, bringing the balance up to 2.6 million.\\n\\nAnd again, on December 2, Binance deposited an additional 1.1 million WTC to their wallet.\\n\\nOn this spreadsheet you can see all of deposits and withdrawals on Binance\\'s wallet address for Walton.\\n\\nSTUDYING THE RE-UPS\\n\\nSo, what can we learn about Binance\\'s token supply based on their patterns of refilling their Walton wallet?\\n\\nHere are the re-ups before the Guardian Node Announcement:\\n\\nAugust 25 — Wallet is created. First deposit batch adds 1.3 million WTC. September 4 — Wallet balance dwindles to 500k WTC. Binance adds 9 million WTC to the wallet. September 11—Binance adds another 7.4 million to the wallet, bringing the wallet to it\\'s highest balance so far, 14.1 million.\\n\\nAnd here are the re-ups since the Walton Guardian Node Announcement on November 27.\\n\\nDecember 1 — Binance deposits 1.2 million. Resulting balance = 2.6 million WTC December 2 — Binance deposits 1.1 million. Resulting balance = 2.8 million',\n",

(no more champs, no more skins, please fix bugs, please add new features, please add a purpose).\\n\\n\\nWhat Hirez didn't realize is that the millions of players that already play Paladins, don't play this game because of its grinding (which does not exist); they play this game because of its unique strategy which combines a balanced diversity of different play-styles (champions) the player can choose from... either to support the overall strategy of his team (comp/pro scene) or to kill as many enemies as possible with that strategy and enjoy it(casual).\\n\\n\\nNow because Hirez didn't realize that, they disturbed that so unique game balance, the balance between those completely different play-styles (champions), the diversity of equally strong yet extremely different styles that makes Paladins stand out of the crowd in the world of gaming!...\\n\\n\\nThey allowed players with non-equal (up to 400% stronger) loadouts to face each other in every game mode of Paladins, except Competitive!\\n\\n\\nNo! Balancing Competitive is not all that matters!\\n\\nCasual has always been a critical success factor for Paladins!\\n\\nMuch more people played Casual than Competitive...\\n\\nI agree that Competitive needs a boost to become a bit more popular but ruining the rest of the game modes isn't the way to go for it!\\n\\n\\nIt is true that the Pro Scene have been advertised a lot lately and literally formed the meta, the trends, the play-styles for both Competitive and Casual.\\n\\nI don't say everyone used those play-styles (especially in low ELO) but the need to catch the opponents off-guard using new strategies in Pro Scene generated a lot of new strategie which kept the game alive and going!\\n\\n\\nIt wasn't the new skins coming out that kept the game alive all this time, but the new strategies developed by the Pros and advertised by the YouTubers!\\n\\n\\nThe disadvantage of this mechanism (although it worked pretty well) is that it only affects more experienced players who spend time to study and test these new strategies.\\n\\nThe newest players aren't affected directly and the only thing that keeps them playing is their curiosity to try out all the champions and make them work somehow... maybe try all the legendary as well.\\n\\nAfter that stage (around level 30-40, idk for sure) and before they enter the stage we mentioned above (where they can test the most of those advanced, team based strategies suggested by Pros) there is a gap where many players might find Paladins boring and give up on it.\\n\\n\\nThere is where the new card system is useful!\\n\\nIt gives a purpose to those players; max out their cards to enjoy an over-powered experience in Casual (e.g. infinite roll cassie, infinite ammo vivian, super mobility maeve, godlike counter zhin, super tank inara, healing god mal'damba etc.)!\\n\\n\\nThis is how the new casual should be advertised; a mode without pressure, where you can experience the ultimate versions of your champions and play around in a variety of maps and modes!\\n\\n\\nThe ONLY way this dream can become reality is to make the process of maxing out cards relatively easy!\\n\\nEvery player that is experienced enough to ''spontaneously form a battle plan, play as a team and adjust his/her playstyle to according to the situation'' or else reach around level 80, should have the majority of his/her cards maxed out!\\n\\n\\nWhile grinding might seem exciting for a new player, for an experienced player it will be frustrating and confusing.\\n\\n\\nJumping from a fair battlefield (like Competitive) to an unfair battlefield (like Casual) will have the following circumstances:\\n\\nA) Confusion (like playing a whole different game).\\n\\nB) Need to adjust strategy based on the team's card levels (more thinking, less casualty).\\n\\nC) Limitation of viable strategies (due to low level cards).\\n\\nD) The player can't trust on his/her own skill and the instincts he/she has developed in Competitive.\\n\\n\\nThe level at which an experienced player is playing, demands a fair battlefield even in Casual settings.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause even the smallest interaction counts.\\n\\nBecause the way that player use his/her game understanding to succeed is spontaneous and based on those interactions.\\n\\n\\nThat's why the grinding should stop after a certain level and every match should be fair (even in casual).\\n\\n\\nA quick calculation on how many cards\",\n",

       " 'There are still a lot of elbows being thrown in the squabble about \"creation\" versus \"curation,\" and it seems to be getting worse. As humans tend to do, we\\'re talking past each other and pretending to simplicity in the face of the complex and the weird. Here\\'s what I think is going on. I think we\\'re getting tripped up by two things: clumsy language and a misapprehension about competition for limited resources.\\n\\nSpringtime for Snipefest\\n\\nEarlier this spring, two well-known bloggers—Maria Popova of Brainpickings and Tina Roth-Eisenberg of Swissmiss—introduced the Curator\\'s Code, a proposed convention for attributing credit to bloggers and other link-finders. The initial discussion that followed mostly skipped over rational critique and went straight for sneering and overheated bluster: it was, apparently, intolerable cheek for these \"self-proclaimed curators\" to want their efforts as digital gravediggers to be recognized when others passed their work along. (Interestingly, comments from journalists whose work is likely to be actually \"curated\" by bloggers, like The Atlantic\\' s Megan Garber and the NYT\\' s David Carr, were far more measured than those that sprang from the jumpy heart of the web design world.) It was all a bit discouraging, but also seemed to be over by mid-April.\\n\\nAlas, it seems not. Last Friday, Jonathan Harris—a sweet internet hippie who makes lovely things—had a quote from a talk tweeted out of context, as tweets from talks inevitably are:\\n\\n\"Curation is replacing creation as a mode of self-expression.\" – Jonathan Harris @jjhnumber27 #creativemornings — Tina Roth Eisenberg (@swissmiss) June 1, 2012\\n\\nAnd that sent The Awl \\'s Choire Sicha—who is not a hippie—into a snarkfest about faux-curators and their cultural climbing. (For the record, Harris was apparently suggesting that this \"replacement\" of creation by curation was something he wanted to combat, not to celebrate.)\\n\\n\"Curation\" Is Still a Stupid Term\\n\\n\"Curation\" strikes a lot of people as a weird, inaccurate thing to call the selection/connection/display activities made possible by the internet. (I wrote a gigantic thing about that awhile back—tl;dr is that we\\'re stuck with the term, and that maybe we should work toward the traditional senses of curation by becoming better caretakers of the content we \"curate.\")\\n\\nIt\\'s probably so difficult to find a word for the practice because it\\'s quite difficult to isolate the underlying impulse from just…being human. This stuff we do on Pinterest and Pinboard and Polyvore and (some) blogs is much less like \"editing\" or \"curating\" and much more like the casual forms of taste display that we participate in when we get dressed in the morning, create mix tapes, collect art, buy and arrange furniture, collect books or records, and banter with clerks in one of the world\\'s three remaining video shops.\\n\\nThe hilarious thing about the \"know your place and respect your elders\" screeds—there are many, and I\\'m not going to link to them—besides the fact that they make those of us who write them sound ancient, is that they don\\'t even read to the people doing the \"curation.\" Serial pinners aren\\'t fighting for cultural credibility by using terms like \"curation.\" They just need a term. Popova herself doesn\\'t like the word.\\n\\nIf I were more awesome, I\\'d go back in time and suggest an alternate word like \"blogger\" that is just palatable enough to come into mainstream use. But I\\'m stuck here like everyone else, so I\\'m going to just tell you that in my own house, and in conversations with my friends, I don\\'t say \"curator\" without hand-flapping airquotes. I say \"bowerbird.\"\\n\\nBirds Not Blogs\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t seen David Attenborough\\'s glorious series The Life of Birds, you\\'re missing out on something really wonderful. In one segment, he introduces the Australian bowerbird, which is notable for the extraordinary display of found materials it creates in order to seduce a mate.\\n\\nSo for now, I\\'m going to just say \"bowerbirds\" instead of \"content curators\" so that I can talk about the practice instead of the title. (I\\'m not suggesting that everyone switch to this term—y\\'all can fight about the language somewhere else.)\\n\\nWhen taste-display happened only offline, it didn\\'t really threaten anyone—except the geniuses at the RIAA, who think mixtapes are deadly and would happily sneak charge you royalties on earworms if they possibly could.\\n\\nOnline, it\\'s different. For one thing,',\n",

Don't get too used to it though, because you'll have to hand it back when you leave!\\n\\nNot content with having an iMac in every room, the hotel has now branched out to offering an iPad to each visitor throughout their stay, with a virtual concierge service as well as menus for the hotel's restaurants being housed on Apple's little tablet of wonder.

       " \"Posted 21 January 2015 - 12:43 AM\\n\\nI installed mine yesterday and it seems to shoot visibly harder than my OMW Alpha Trooper and Rampage. I'll be running the Immortal Longstrike through its paces in a few weeks at the Bowling Green HvZ Winter Invitational, but until then, I'll spend time making it functionally a better blaster for HvZ purposes.\\n\\n\\nDid yours not come with catch springs either?\\n\\n\\nw/ barrel extension\\n\\nwithout barrel extension\\n\\nNope Mine did not come with the catch springs. I've already emailed OMW along with a few other issuesSo I finished the install with the 7kg srping, well let's start off with the Pros-direct install, no modding neededCons-7kg spring priming gets tiring after 80+ rounds of constant firingBefore picAfter PicI was able to run some shots off the chrony but before the results I ran into some quality issues with the kitAs stated above mine also did not come with the catch springs. In addition dart fit on the breech was looser than what I am accustomed to from OMW. During test fit some of the darts fell out. I cant use my Xplorer darts because of the fit or any other dart where the diameter is smaller than a stock elite. Stefans, forget it, the performance was horrible (glue tip, xtip, stock tip, back rod, cut down nerf, xplorer). Last but not least the plunger tube was not molded well. For whatever reason mine had some casting or something leftover. I had to do my best in sanding it down without compromising the tube. I will check the o-ring after a few more rounds to see if it is tearing it up. Here are the picsPlunger tube out of the packagePlunger tube afterwardsOn with the Chrony numbers (10 shots, with new elites)92.1195.8890.9290.8892.5389.7698.69100.790.05125.10 (anamoly..)99.82102.5107.3105.4105.4102.0103.1109.9109.9103.6So all in all, the kit is definitely better than the massacre kit. Good performance and can probably get better with some more tweaks and even a brass breech or angel breech. Priming with my xplorer grip was tiring so not sure that will work well in a war. My stage 3 OMW retaliator easily outperforms this kit. But it's a nice drop in kit and this is what the longstrike really needed and should have been from the beginning.Should you buy it? That's a decision left for you decide. I like the kit.\",\n",
       " 'While Christian Pulisic was offering compelling and historic evidence in Dortmund that he\\'s more than ready to start on the right in this month\\'s vital World Cup qualifiers, his national team coach, Bruce Arena, said Wednesday that he\\'s ready to see another Bundesliga star anchor the U.S. left.\\n\\nIt\\'s been an issue that\\'s followed Fabian Johnson since he became a U.S. regular in 2012. He\\'s dangerous and dynamic going forward and has spent much of his career as a wide midfielder, first for TSG Hoffenheim and now for Borussia Mönchengladbach. But he\\'s an effective outside back as well, and it\\'s there that the USA\\'s need has been greatest.\\n\\nJohnson started at right back during the 2014 World Cup and then once DaMarcus Beasley stepped aside (temporarily), the Munich native spent more time on the left. Former U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann experimented in an effort to get Johnson higher up the field but never found a solution. Johnson was in back at the 2015 Gold Cup and 2016 Copa América Centenario and made only his second and third midfield starts of \\'16 in Klinsmann\\'s final two games. Sporting Kansas City center back Matt Besler was out on the left as the USA fell to Mexico and Costa Rica.\\n\\nSpeaking during a Facebook chat on Wednesday, Arena indicated that he\\'s ready to see if he can steer Johnson toward becoming regular international midfielder.\\n\\n\"He plays almost on a regular basis as a left-sided midfielder at Mönchengladbach and if we can, we want to play Fabian in the midfield,\" Arena said. \"So that\\'s obviously one of our goals in 2017, is to find a position for him and allow him to play it on a consistent basis.\"\\n\\nArena wasn\\'t ready to make a full commitment, however, because spots in back remain unsettled. And with the Honduras (March 24) and Panama (March 28) games coming up, and with at least four points a virtual necessity, Arena may have to keep the tweaking to a minimum this month.\\n\\n\"I wish I could give you the answer right now,\" he said when asked who was the current first-choice left back. \"All kinds of possibilities exist—from Fabian Johnson, who I indicated our preference is to have him in the midfield. Jorge Villafaña and Greg Garza had good showings in January and February with us in camp. Also DaMarcus Beasley showed well in his first game with Houston over the past weekend, so those are all four candidates.\"\\n\\nArena went on to mention Tim Ream, Besler and Eric Lichaj as dark-horse options.\\n\\n\"We\\'re hopeful that we\\'re going to arrive at the right plan,\" the manager said.\\n\\nArena reiterated that he\\'s considering a pool of around 40 players and plans to name a team of 23-25 on March 15. The squad won\\'t gather in San Jose until the 20th, leaving Arena and his staff with the option to make a change or two based on form, injury and what happens that final weekend. They face an interesting challenge. The players with whom Arena is most familiar are in MLS. He coached against them while with the LA Galaxy and spent a month working with them at the recent U.S. camp. But the players who are the fittest and most in-form are in Europe and Mexico. The only interaction Arena has had with them has been from the stands or over the phone. The four days of training leading up to the Honduras game will be vital, as Arena told reporters earlier this week that his foreign-based charges have an edge.\\n\\n\"The players abroad are certainly match fit and a little bit sharper,\" he said. \"You could see the MLS games this weekend. The teams aren\\'t fit yet—not a whole lot of combination play. They\\'re just starting. It takes time. That\\'s what the Premiership looks like in August as well. It\\'s no different. I think all things being equal, I would think we would lean towards a player who has been playing on a regular basis or training on a regular basis.\"\\n\\nHe added Wednesday, \"For the most part I was fairly pleased [with the MLS openers]. This weekend is going to be very important for the MLS players as we make our final decisions.\"\\n\\nArena said he likely would be in Kansas City this weekend as Sporting KC hosts FC Dallas.\\n\\nHere are a few more highlights from Arena\\'s chat on Wednesday:\\n\\n— Regarding the goalkeepers, he said Real Salt Lake\\'s Nick Rimando emerged from January camp with \"a little bit of an edge\" over his domestic competition. Tim Howard has been out since suffering a groin injury against Mexico and wasn\\'t on the active roster when the Colorado Rapids began their season last weekend.\\n\\n\"We\\'re waiting to see whether he plays for Colorado this weekend,\" Arena said. \"If',\n",
       " 'Ask any startup veteran: Mistakes are made. No matter how successful a company ultimately becomes, you can be sure that its early days were peppered with missteps and failures—most minor, but a few likely painful and spectacular.\\n\\nSo, why would anyone want to share those mistakes with the world? That\\'s the question of the day for Lauren Kay and Emma Tessler, co-founders of Dating Ring, an online matchmaking service. The company is the subject of season two of the podcast Startup, which premieres on Thursday.\\n\\nStartup devotes each season to chronicling the ups and downs of a single fledgling company. The first season followed the show\\'s creator, Alex Blumberg, as he attempted to launch his own podcasting company. As far as podcasts go, Blumberg is something of a superstar, with successful runs at both This American Life and NPR\\'s Planet Money. That didn\\'t stop him from going off the rails during the show, though. Listeners heard Blumberg stutter through disastrous VC pitches and agonize over whether he was taking the company in the right direction. The tape caught dozens of fraught exchanges between Blumberg and his wife, his partner, his investors and several of his overworked employees.\\n\\nKay and Tessler say they expect Dating Ring to get the same warts-and-all treatment. (They are continuing to tape through June and will not hear any of the episodes before they air.) Fundraising—\"or trying to\"—will be a major theme of the season, says Kay. The company has raised only $355,000 so far, so listeners will also hear frank discussion of how long the founders can continue without an infusion of cash.\\n\\nWhat else will we hear this season? A partner leaves the company unexpectedly, say Kay and Tessler. The pair will also discuss the details of their experience at Y Combinator; Dating Ring was part of the incubator\\'s class of January 2014. They say the Startup staff has interviewed a number of people, including Y Combinator partners and the head of competitor Match.com. And of course, Kay and Tessler don\\'t know what was said in these interviews. \"Maybe it will be cool,\" says Kay. \"Or maybe it will be more like middle school, when people would talk about you behind your back.\"\\n\\nThe pair say that, while they\\'re \"terrified\" of what the podcast may expose about the company (or the founders themselves), they didn\\'t hesitate to sign on when they were selected by the Startup producers. They hope the publicity will boost their user numbers (Dating Ring currently has 3,000 or so active members, about 15% of whom pay the $240 fee for a three-month membership ) and push the company achieve profitability. \"We\\'re really hoping that being on Startup will be the push we need,\" says Kay.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the company\\'s first time in the media spotlight. Last year, Kay noticed a striking imbalance in the Dating Ring membership: In New York City, they had far more female clients, while their San Francisco database was dominated by men. So, the company cooked up a stunt: Cross-Country Love, a crowdfunded event where the company flew 16 single female New Yorkers out to the west coast for a long weekend of dates with Silicon Valley bachelors. Not surprisingly, the trip got a lot of press—not all of it positive. Valleywag memorably compared the participants to \"comfort women,\" the women forced into sex slavery in World War II.\\n\\nWhile much of the coverage was biting, Kay says she still sees the Cross-Country Love trip as a success. \"It was huge for us, it put us on the map,\" she says, adding that in the wake of the publicity, Dating Ring\\'s user base doubled in size.\\n\\n\"It\\'s totally nerve-wracking to put your professional and personal life out there,\" says Tessler. \"But everything is fair game.\" The founders say were willing to answer almost any question Startup producers threw their way. Because their startup is a dating company, they say they talked a lot about their dating and sex lives, though Tessler asked that the podcast skip the questions about her boyfriend\\'s sex life. \"That\\'s the only place I drew the line,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Occasionally I didn\\'t record certain things,\" says Kay. \"There were a lot of difficult moments when I was really upset.\" On the other hand, she says the recordings also captured some great moments. \"I had a very emotional conversation with my mom, where she said some of the nicest things she\\'s ever said,\" says Kay. \"Now I\\'ll always have that.\"\\n\\nFortune plans to follow up with Kay and Tessler once the season is underway. That, says Kay, sounds great, provided \"we are able to show our faces in the media again.\"\\n\\nTo subscribe to Kristen Bellstrom\\'s daily newsletter on the world\\'s most',\n",

This is exactly what it\\'s like. And that\\'s what bothers me so much about Bernie right now.\\n\\nTo me, Bernie is the guy who never got married because he couldn\\'t commit but then turned 40 and realized he was all alone, but instead of finding someone to start a family with, he pursues a married woman.\\n\\nA woman who has been married for just over 20 years and the youngest kid is just about on their way to start college. She and her husband have their problems, but they love each other and they are learning to focus on each other again after raising a family together. But it\\'s hard. They were married young, because she got pregnant. They struggled a lot early on, because they were poor. But after a lot of sacrifices and a lot of fights they figured out how to make it work and pull ahead and now that their kids are moving out they finally have another chance to have a life together. But there is a lot of work to be done to rebuild their relationship. There is a lot of hurt to heal. It\\'s really hard for both of them, but they love each other and they want to be together. It was really scary for a while there, but if they don\\'t give up on each other, they are going to make it.\\n\\nThat\\'s the Democratic party to me. Is it perfect? No. Has it fucked up? Yes. But it\\'s also a wonderful party that has done incredible things including electing the first black President and after a lot of ups and downs it\\'s really finally feeling like it\\'s on it\\'s way to being a truly great party again.\\n\\nAnd just as that is happening, along comes Bernie. He knows how to push all of the buttons pointing out all of the imperfections and fuck ups and pain and he promises a wonderful future and there is no history with him of struggling and fighting and your kids have really seem to like him and it is so tempting to just walk away from a painful difficult history and start over with someone new.\\n\\nThere was a reply to that comment I quoted above.\\n\\nYes, party loyalty should come before anything else.\\n\\nWhen I read that I felt sick to my stomach. Loyalty being talked about as if it were a weakness instead of a strength.\\n\\nI have liked Bernie for years. Since around 2007/8. But I have never liked that he is running for the nomination of our party. It didn\\'t seem right to me, since he\\'s been an independent for 40 years. But I have really not liked how he has treated this party as he has run. Throwing everyone under the bus who stands in his way.\\n\\nMy wife and I have been married for over 15 years. In the first few years, we moved to a big city for me to get a programming job and for her to go to college. I didn\\'t get one right away, so, we both ended up getting shift manager jobs at a video store chain. It was a hard time for us, because we were very poor and in a new city all alone and we ended up working opposite shifts from each other, so, we bare saw each other for months.\\n\\nMy wife and I had pretty different approaches to running shifts. She was by the book and I was more relaxed. She got everything done on time. I made the store a lot of money by making friends with all the customers. My boss quit and for a while her boss ran my store as well. He was a pretty good looking guy who flirted with the girls who worked at the store a lot. He didn\\'t particularly care for my style, but my shifts made more money than any other store in the city and he was stretched pretty thin, so, he just let it go. At least with me.\\n\\nWith my wife he started talking shit about me. He had already tried flirting with her and it hadn\\'t really worked out for him. He was the kind of guy who didn\\'t take that as a hint. He took it as a challenge. He just tried harder and part of how he tried was to try to put a wedge between her and I. He actually pressed her for why she was with me. I didn\\'t know this was happening at the time, because… well, because she didn\\'t want me to walk into the store and knock him the fuck out… but she told me months later when I left.\\n\\nI have never hated anyone in my life, but I came pretty close with that guy. He wanted something, so he fucked with my marriage to try to get it. I didn\\'t really have anything to worry about, because my wife loves me. But I still felt violated.

Almost nothing is made 100% in the United States anymore. But what about firearms? As one of the few countries that affords its citizens the right to bear arms, you'd think more firearms manufacturers would be exclusively based out of here.\\n\\nWell, turns out that's not always the case. If you follow the supply chain long enough, you're going to find a part of a product made outside of the United States. But if you're adamant about keeping your hard earned money inside the country and supporting good craftsmanship, we'll discuss a few firearms manufacturers that mostly stay within the United States.\\n\\nRuger\\n\\nRuger and Smith & Wesson are almost tied in terms of firearms production and sales in the United States. Ruger, however, tries to keep much of their manufacturing process located right in the United States. Smith & Wesson – especially for the M&P Shield line of pistols – stayed within the United States.\\n\\nBoth are considered the leaders in United States firearms manufacturing. The quality of their arms is well recognized throughout.\\n\\nA few notable pistols from Ruger:\\n\\nRuger SR9c – The SR9c is a compact pistol with full-size capabilities. A magazine capacity of 17 rounds and plenty of accolades on function – it's an affordable choice for compact concealed carry.\\n\\nRuger Sr9c Holster\\n\\nRuger Sr9c Holster Ruger LCP – This is one of their flagship pistols designed especially to be affordable, reliable, and very concealable.\\n\\nRuger LCP Holster\\n\\nKimber\\n\\nKimber quickly rose to fame with their heavily customized 1911 variants. Hailed as champions of match-grade quality 1911s as well as compact carry versions, Kimber can easily be said to be a company that has focused heavily on craftsmanship over quantity. And it shows – both in the price tag as well as the function. But, they keep it local and do the vast majority of their manufacturing within the United States.\\n\\nNotable Kimber pistols:\\n\\nKimber 1911 Compact – A slightly more compact 1911, it's for those who want a shorter form factor without sacrificing full-size capability.\\n\\nKimber 1911 Compact Holster\\n\\nKimber 1911 Compact Holster Kimber 1911 Pro Model – How much better does it get in the world of 1911s? Not only does Kimber make a beautifully designed full-size professional grade 1911, it works surprisingly well as an everyday concealed carry choice.\\n\\nKimber Pro Holster\\n\\nKimber Pro Holster Kimber Solo – Kimber decided to dip its feet into the waters of the sub-compact concealed carry community with the Kimber Solo. Despite some complaints on its function, it's overall proven itself to be durable and easily hidden in an IWB holster.\\n\\nKimber Solo Holster\\n\\nKel-Tec\\n\\nA lot of people like to rag on Kel-Tec because their pistols and rifles don't look as sleek and attractive as Kimber or Ruger. If you subtract the aesthetics, you wind up with a fantastic, cheap, and All-American made series of concealed carry pistols. This company has prided itself on staying within the United States despite the easy reduction in manufacturing cost of going overseas. And you know what? They produce excellent concealed carry pistols.\\n\\nNotable concealed carry pistols:\\n\\nP-3AT – This concealed carry pistol, chambered in .380 ACP, has proven itself to be a reliable choice for concealed carriers. It is classified as a sub-compact and no matter how critics want to hate it – most end up admitting it's a very decent choice for those looking for reliability and price point.\\n\\nP-3AT Holster\\n\\nHi-Point\\n\\nHi-Point makes the Walmart of pistols. Dirt cheap and backed by a life-time guarantee, despite the overwhelming bad talk about their main pistol line – this is a reasonably reliable American-made firearms manufacturer.\\n\\nBest of all? Hi-Point is guaranteed to produce a compact pistol in most major calibers that will fit nearly anyone's budget.\\n\\nNotable compact pistols:\\n\\nHi-Point 916 – At less than $200 (MSRP), it's priced to sell. The Hi-Point 916 is surprisingly rugged for it's polymer frame.\\n\\nHi Point 916 Holster\\n\\nHonorable Mention: Wilson Combat\\n\\nWilson Combat's 4-inch 1911 - Wilson Combat's 4 inch 1911 was designed for those who preferred the 1911 frame and need match-grade quality in their concealed carry choice.\\n\\nWilson Combat 1911 4 inch Holster<\\n\\nThere are certainly more manufacturers that have a legacy of producing their excellent firearms in the United States.

       " \"Give a man a fish, the adage goes, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime. But what happens when the one who needs fish is a fisherman?\\n\\nLast month, the federal government took a long-awaited step toward answering that question when Congress allocated $75 million in fisheries disaster aid. Now the hard part begins for the National Marine Fisheries Service. First it must come up with a plan to divide the assistance among six different fisheries nationwide. Then it must determine how to spend the money that goes to each region.\\n\\nThe New England groundfishery, which targets cod, haddock, and flounders, received its disaster declaration in 2012 following decades of overfishing, and a failure of fish populations to recover despite increasingly strict limits on the catch. In addition to excessive harvest of fish, the ecosystem has also suffered from the compounding challenge of climate change.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTogether, these factors have left it dangerously out of balance. With this influx of cash, which could represent the last hope for America's first fishery, regulators and fishermen must weigh their desire to provide immediate assistance to industry members against the opportunity to make the entire groundfishery more solvent. The easy path — one for which some industry members and local politicians have advocated — would have regulators simply divide the money among active fishermen, allowing them to pay down their loans and perhaps save their boats or houses for another year or two. But then what? This fishery won't recover for far longer than that.\\n\\nGet Today in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday-Friday. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\\n\\nAccording to a recent report from the National Marine Fisheries Service, groundfish revenue fell by $24 million in 2012, a 23 percent decline. And this plunge doesn't account for drastic reductions in catch limits which took effect in 2013 and will remain for at least another two years. When the revenue figures for 2013 come out, things will undoubtedly look much worse than they do today. Thus, no matter how much of the $75 million ends up in New England, there won't be enough to sustain the industry until the fish come back.\\n\\nAbsent adequate fish or funding to solve the problem, the only solution is to reduce the number of fishermen, something that is already occurring albeit in an unplanned way. Since 2009, the number of boats making at least one groundfish trip has dropped by 30 percent. And it will fall further.\\n\\nOne way regulators should help to responsibly manage this loss of fishing businesses, is through implementation a buyback of groundfish permits. While the total amount likely won't be enough to fund the entirety of a buyback program, a relatively small amount of disaster funding could be used for a federal loan guarantee, leveraging additional cash to buy permits from willing sellers.\\n\\nThose who remain would then pay back the loan over time using a percentage of revenue they generate from having access to more fish. Additional funds could also be made available to cover the first year or two of interest payments. Past attempts to implement buyback programs in US fisheries have shown that designing an effective framework isn't easy, but it can be done. In groundfishery, the industry must develop a structure that allows for a graceful exit from the fishery for those who choose it while preventing a scenario in which the only surviving operators are large vessels consolidated in fewer fishing ports.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe program must not simply shift the focus onto other fisheries like monkfish or lobster. And it must allow access to the next generation of fishermen once fish populations have begun to bounce back, with continued participation in traditional ports from downeast Maine out to Provincetown and down to Long Island. Because the upfront cost of a buyback would be low, it could be just a small part of a broader disaster relief package. There would still be funding to alleviate fishermen's financial hardship, to implement programs aimed at protecting smaller fishing communities, and to pay fishermen who remain to engage in cooperative research programs with scientists.\\n\\nAccepting a buyback will be no easy decision for many fishermen. Any New Englander knows fishing is not just a job. It's a way of life — often one that spans generations. There will be anguish in leaving it behind. But for some, there will also be relief. And for those who remain, less competition may mean a real chance at a future.\\n\\nRegardless of how the agency and the industry decide to allocate the funding, it must be used to not just buoy the existing industry, but primarily to invest in its future. They may not be able to give fishermen more fish. But they may yet be able to make this fishery last a lifetime.\\n\\nMichael Conathanis director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress.\",\n",
       " \"When I saw the announcement last week from RunKeeper and Pebble that RunKeeper had released the final non-beta integration with the smart-watch, I was excited to dive into it. While the Pebble watch was certainly not the first smart watch out there (that title goes to a long line of poorly designed watches aimed at geeks like me), it was the first watch to get massive media attention. Which in turn translated to massive Kickstarter sales and funding. Becoming at the time the biggest Kickstarter project ever (by funds raised).\\n\\nDuring their Kickstarter campaign a year ago both Pebble and RunKeeper had touted the potential integration between the two companies. After all, it was the very first app partnership announced. It seemed like it might just be the start of a new wave of fitness watches driven by the phone. For those not familiar with Pebble as a concept, it's a smart-phone connected watch that displays notifications from apps (be it e-mail, texts or 3rd party apps) on your wrist. The idea was that apps could leverage Pebble for deeper integration and control – ultimately minimizing the need to remove your phone from your pocket. It would still be there, you just won't have to touch it as often.\\n\\nHowever, after using it, there's really only one word to describe it:\\n\\nUnderwhelmed.\\n\\nNo wait, there's another one. Well, actually, an image might be better:\\n\\nSo why am I so un-impressed? Well, let's go through a brief overview.\\n\\nFirst, you'll need the RunKeeper app installed. Quite logically obviously, since in the Pebble 'design', the app is driving the experience. No problems, I had that and was good to go! Note, available on both Android and iOS.\\n\\nNow, there isn't really any configuration options for the Pebble watch within RunKeeper. You can't turn it on or off, it's just…well…there. You can see it in this tiny little icon in the upper left corner:\\n\\nEssentially if your Pebble is nearby, it's about to get RunKeeper'd.\\n\\nOnce that's done, you're basically ready to run. You'll just want to hit the big 'Start Activity' button on the app and stash your phone somewhere.\\n\\nI stash mine in a simple armband. Nothing fancy.\\n\\nAbout 15 seconds later, the run will actually start. This is a timer delay built-in to ensure you have time to do the stashing. In the meantime, the Pebble display will now change to the RunKeeper page:\\n\\nOnce you've started your run, the watch will display your total time, total distance and average pace.\\n\\nIf you want to pause the timer (like at a cross-walk such as below), you simply press the middle Pebble button, which pauses the app on the phone instantly. Same goes for resuming. I'll give credit where credit is due, this part works well.\\n\\nNext, if you want to change the display field to something other than pace, you'll just press one of the up/down buttons.\\n\\nOh.\\n\\nWait.\\n\\nYou mean those buttons don't do anything?\\n\\nOh, I see.\\n\\nNo worries, I must be able to configure it somewhere else, right? You know, like in the RunKeeper app settings on my phone or something. Or change to speed for cycling? Or trigger a lap, right?\\n\\nNo, no, and no? Oh.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nSo, what can you do Mr. RunKeeper Pebble?\\n\\nThat's it? You mean, this post isn't destined for In-Depth Review status?\\n\\nWell then. That's…uhh…underwhelming.\\n\\nAnd thus, the end of my Pebble/RunKeeper experience.\\n\\nI guess I don't get it. As it stands now, the level of coding displayed seems to rival that of what a single high school student could do in an afternoon (without even a can of Mountain Dew or pizza). They had a YEAR to do something cool. And ultimately, it does the most basic thing on earth – display three non-changeable data fields.\\n\\nThey had a year to sit there and make a mess of Cambridge whiteboards on creating a kick-ass app that could have shown the rest of the smart-watch world what an app could have done in a connected device scenario. Surely that's 365 days of back of the napkin ideas that could have been implemented.\\n\\nThey had a year to leverage the power of Bluetooth Smart on the phone platform and do stuff like show heart rate metrics that RunKeeper already supports today. How hard could it really have been to simply add a way to customize the data pages? Or to create laps? Or to show laps since RunKeeper was tracking them anyway.\\n\\nOn RunKeeper\",\n",

       " 'In The Arena Barack Obama\\'s Better Half Why the first lady is so popular.\\n\\nMichelle Obama is a popular first lady. On average, her favorable ratings have been higher than those of her predecessors, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton. This may well reflect the fact that more so than other first ladies, Mrs. Obama has a stand-alone personal image. Unlike other recent first ladies, her popularity has not fallen or risen with her husband\\'s.\\n\\nHow popular is Michelle? A steady two-thirds of the public has held a favorable view of Mrs. Obama, according to nationwide Gallup poll and Pew Research Center surveys, for most of her time as first lady. At 69 percent, her average Pew Research Center favorable ratings have been only somewhat higher than Laura Bush\\'s (65 percent) but considerably higher than Hillary Clinton\\'s (55 percent) during Bill Clinton\\'s term in office.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nLaura Bush was never a polarizing first lady, but views of her soured somewhat near the end of her husband\\'s unpopular second term. In late 2007, her favorable rating fell to 54 percent from a high of 70 percent.\\n\\nHillary\\'s ratings rose and fell substantially over the course of her time in the White House, reaching a low of 42 percent in early 1996 as fallout from her spearheading her husband\\'s unpopular health care reform effort. But they rebounded over the course of Bill Clinton\\'s second term, especially during the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when the public rallied sympathetically to the first lady. Her ratings slipped again afterward, even as Bill\\'s approval ratings remained fairly high.\\n\\nThe arc of Michelle\\'s popularity is strikingly different — in fact, it\\'s more of a flat line than an arc. Barack\\'s sinking poll numbers haven\\'t dragged down Michelle. As the president\\'s approval score has ranged from the mid 50s to the low 40s, the first lady\\'s have oscillated around the mid to high 60s. The polls do show consistently, however, that in an era of polarization, she has been much less well liked by conservatives, Republicans and white men. Her biggest fans have been women, Democrats and African-Americans.\\n\\nSo why did the president\\'s unpopularity drag down Laura Bush\\'s and Hillary Clinton\\'s numbers but not Michelle Obama\\'s? In-depth polling about perceptions of her by The Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that broad segments of the public hold positive views of Michelle\\'s personal qualities that transcend partisanship, gender and race. Supermajorities of men and women, blacks and whites, Republicans and Democrats alike see Michelle as intelligent, a good role model for women and a good mother.\\n\\nAnd even though Republicans, white men and conservatives have held only mixed views of her overall, her strong positive image has prevented a sharp downturn in attitudes among groups that have become super critics of the president.\\n\\nIn short, more so than other recent first ladies, the public views Michelle Obama as her own person, and her image has not been tied closely to swings in judgments about her husband.\\n\\nThe numbers inevitably raise the question of what Michelle will do with her popularity — an increasingly rare asset in these hyperpartisan times. In recent weeks, as rumors circulated that she might run for Senate in Illinois, Michelle quickly quashed them, telling Robin Roberts of ABC News that her next act would be \"service focused,\" not political. Roberts pressed: \"You sure you\\'re not getting into politics?\" Replied Michelle: \"I am positive.\" White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama family friend, was even more Shermanesque in a recent appearance on NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press.\" \"I\\'m absolutely 100 percent positive that will never happen.\"\\n\\nThat seems like a pretty firm no. It should also be borne in mind that in this highly polarized era, any political move will be judged in a much more partisan way than Michelle Obama has experienced thus far — witness how Hillary Clinton\\'s poll numbers have slid as she has reentered the political arena. But should she change her mind, the first lady would have a strong head start.\\n\\nAndrew Kohut is founding director of the Pew Research Center.',\n",

There may be more to the events than meets the eye, however, as a social media posting said to be from the student group states it has been given directions by the Chinese Consulate.\\n\\nThe Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibet and has been in exile since March 1959, when he fled Tibet fearing the Chinese occupiers intended to abduct him. Tibet was invaded by the Chinese Communist Party\\'s (CCP) People\\'s Liberation Army in October 1950. The CCP pushes a line that it \"liberated\" Tibet and heavily censors information on the topic, while calling the Dalai Lama a \"separatist.\"\\n\\nThe group trying to prevent the speech is a local branch of the Chinese Student and Scholars Association (CSSA), a nationwide student organization known to receive funding and directives from the CCP through its consulates in the United States.\\n\\nThe CSSA has openly stated it is working under the guidance of the Chinese regime.\\n\\nIt published a statement on WeChat (a Chinese instant messaging platform) that states, translated from Chinese, that \"the Chinese Student and Scholar Association has asked the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles for instructions and, having received the instructions, is going to implement them.\"\\n\\nIt tells students to not act outside official guidance of the CCP, and says \"specific measures to be taken will be elaborated on in future announcements.\"\\n\\n\"Our association has been forced to take tough and unyielding measures,\" it states.\\n\\nThe statement appears to have been taken offline, but a web archive of the page is still available.\\n\\nThe \"About Us\" page for the CSSA at the university, translated from Chinese, says it is a \"public benefit organization\" and is \"affiliated to the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles.\" It also says it works as a \"Chinese Embassy bridge.\"\\n\\nOvert Espionage\\n\\nAccording to the report \"China\\'s Espionage Dynasty: Economic Death by a Thousand Cuts,\" published by cybersecurity think tank Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology (ICIT), there are active CSSAs at more than 150 U.S. universities.\\n\\nOfficially, the CSSAs help native Chinese students by acting as a bridge between China and foreign institutions. On the other hand, \"CSSAs may also be a pivotal overt espionage platform for the Chinese government,\" says the ICIT report.\\n\\n\"The vast majority of CSSAs receive funding from the Chinese government or have an active liaison via the consulate back to the CCP,\" it states.\\n\\nIt adds that CSSAs may work to \"persuade students to act as temporary or prolonged intelligence assets,\" and that \"through CSSAs, students can be manipulated into passing intellectual property or research back to their home state or planting malware on a university system.\"\\n\\nAccording to an FBI podcast on April 14, 2014, it\\'s not uncommon for foreign intelligence agencies to manipulate students to achieve their objectives—and the students are often unaware they are being used until they\\'re already in over their heads.\\n\\n\"To foster the relationship, foreign intelligence operatives will flatter and encourage students, show interest in their future success, and even promise to help them obtain a government-issued visa or work permit—but it\\'s all disingenuous and empty promises,\" said Mollie Halpem, host of the \"Inside the FBI\" podcast.\\n\\nShe added, \"The truth is, the operatives are just using the student as a pawn to achieve their own ends, without concern for the student\\'s welfare or future.\"\\n\\nControlling the Narrative\\n\\nPreventing a speech by the Dalai Lama at a U.S. university may not seem like a big deal, but for the CCP, its use of censorship and controlled narratives are cornerstones of its hold on power. The Party simultaneously pushes its own narratives on issues, peppered with disinformation, while also using extreme censorship to stop the true narratives from being known.\\n\\nThe issue of Tibet—which includes the CCP\\'s suppression of Tibetan Buddhists—is one of the CCP\\'s five \"no-go topics,\" which also includes its persecution of Falun Gong, its persecution of Muslim Uyghurs, the issue of Taiwanese independence, and the issue of democracy in Hong Kong.\\n\\nThe CCP\\'s censorship apparatus stretches beyond its own borders, and looks to control similar narratives being raised by foreign governments and news outlets.\\n\\n\"In many cases, Chinese officials directly impede independent reporting by media based abroad,\" states a 2013 report from the Center for International Media Assistance.\\n\\nIt adds, however, that \"more prevalent–and often more effective–are methods of control that subtly',\n",
       " 'The Pentagon has spent billions of dollars on efforts to make itself audit-ready in time for not one, but two deadlines – one in 2014, the other in 2017.\\n\\nIt won\\'t meet the first and probably won\\'t meet the second.\\n\\nThe deadlines represent efforts inside and outside of the Pentagon toward meeting a goal that has eluded it since the mid-1990s, when all government departments were first required by law to submit to annual audits. The Defense Department, alone among all federal agencies, has so far failed to meet that requirement – leaving trillions of dollars in cumulative annual defense budgets unaudited.\\n\\nAmid fierce national debate over ballooning national debt, Congress in 2009 passed a law to prod the Pentagon, setting a 2017 deadline for audit-readiness. Two years later, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta added to the pressure, ordering that a significant portion of the Pentagon\\'s books – its annual report on the status of all appropriations – be audit-ready by 2014.\\n\\nThat report, the Statement of Budgetary Resources, is, in essence, the Pentagon\\'s checkbook, showing the amount of money from congressional appropriations spent or committed to being spent, and the amount remaining for new spending. Without it, there is no way to budget accurately or ensure accountability.\\n\\nTina Jonas, Defense Department comptroller from 2004 through 2008 and now president of UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans, says that when she was drafting budgets, the lack of reliable financial statements made it impossible for her to know how much money the Pentagon had and how much it needed. \"I didn\\'t want to ask Congress for money that we didn\\'t need,\" she says.\\n\\nA senior Pentagon official confirmed that the 2014 deadline won\\'t be met. The Pentagon discreetly acknowledged the same in an unremarkable passage on page 5 of section II of the November 2012 \"Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan Status Report\" from Defense Department Comptroller Robert Hale\\'s office: \"The scope of first year audits of the SBR (Statement of Budgetary Resources) in FY 2015 will be limited to audits of schedules containing only current year appropriation activity.\" (Panetta\\'s order requires that the SBR be audit-ready in 2014 so that a first audit can be conducted in 2015.)\\n\\nThat means the audit will ignore the hundreds of billions of dollars in unspent appropriations from previous years, as when, for example, Congress approves a multiyear weapons contract. The reason, Pentagon officials said, is that huge amounts of essential data have been lost in the Pentagon\\'s accounting systems, or were never recorded in the first place. The comptroller\\'s office said that out of $992 billion in appropriations, about $220 billion won\\'t be examined, using estimates based on 2012 numbers.\\n\\n\"This is a tactical change that refines the scope of the audit,\" said Jennifer Elzea, a spokeswoman for the secretary of defense. \"It does not change the goal, which is to improve the strength of our business processes and the quality of our financial information.\"\\n\\nComptroller Hale said through a spokesman this month: \"I expect most DoD budget statements will be ready for audit. It is possible that, because of budget turmoil and other problems, a few may not be ready.\"\\n\\nLack of trustworthy data also makes the 2017 legally mandated deadline a long shot. Absent reliable accounting systems in the military services and other defense agencies, it will remain impossible to trace specific accounting entries to the \"transaction level\" to determine what the money paid for and whether the goods or services were delivered. Rivalries among the military services and Defense Department offices that want to keep their own systems also stand in the way. So does the services\\' inability to figure out a way to value assets like ships, planes and weaponry.\\n\\nFor these reasons, says Gordon Adams, an American University professor of U.S. foreign policy and a specialist on defense issues, \"we\\'ll get to 2017, and if past is prologue, the Defense Department will just move the goal posts again.\"\\n\\nFor decades, fighting and winning the Cold War dominated Congress\\'s permissive approach to annual Pentagon appropriations. Then Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1992, requiring annual audits of all federal departments, did lawmakers begin to pressure the Pentagon to manage its purse like any other government department. The law mandated that the Pentagon by audit-ready by 1996.\\n\\nBut year after year, top defense officials would appear before the House and Senate armed services committees to be scolded for missing their deadlines, and then they would set new ones. The next year, and the next, the scene was re-enacted. Congress and the White House stood back as more than half a trillion taxpayer dollars a year went unaudited.\\n\\nJust weeks into his new job as secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld stated the problem: \"Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion',\n",
       " '�What do you know, people outside our company actually played our games,� joked Noah Falstein, Google�s chief gamesman, in response to the turnout for his �Lucasfilm Games Postmortem� panel session at GDC 2014 this morning.\\n\\n\\nIt�s the first time GDC has ever hosted a postmortem discussion of a studio, rather than a game, and while Falstein worked to guide the talk through a chronological retelling of Lucasfilm Games� formation and early work, discussion amongst the panelists � former Lucasfilm Games members Ron Gilbert, Chip Morningstar, David Fox, Peter Langston, and Steve Arnold � quickly slid into the realm of reminiscing and fond remembrances.\\n\\n\\nPeter Langston, who wrote his first computer game in 1965, was essentially the founding member of Lucasfilm Games, and the first panelist to share his memories of working at the studio.\\n\\n\\n�My main goal was to use modern technology in the games business,� said Langston, when describing how he was first hired in 1982 to start a new enterprise on behalf of Lucas, outside of the film business.\\n\\n\\n�Console games at that time were pretty crude�they had to run on machines like the Atari 2600.�\\n\\n\\nTimes were so tough, said Langston, that console developers would often think of available memory in bits rather than bytes, because it was wasteful to devote a byte of memory to something if 7 bits would do.\\n\\n\\nLangston claims Lucasfilm Games took in a million dollars in its first year, even though they didn�t make any games � they made tools. But they also started experimenting with game development � one prototype generated anti-aliased graphics in real-time, while another was able to generate music from places beyond the player�s point of view. .\\n\\n\\nDavid Fox, a founding member of Lucasfilm Games who worked on games like Labyrinth and Zak McKracken, shared stories of trying to pitch what would become Rescue on Fractalus.\\n\\n\\n�I wanted to do a Star Wars game, but I was told that we were not allowed to do Star Wars titles,� said Fox, who had joined the company specifically to work within the Star Wars universe.\\n\\n\\nFox says when he first showed his space fighter pilot game prototype to George Lucas, the filmmaker pointed out that Fox had failed to include a fire button -- the developer had assumed players would simply defeat enemies by outmaneuvering them and leading them into crashing into the mountains.\\n\\n\\nSteve Arnold is now an experienced venture capitalist, but back in the early \\'80s he left Atari to lead Lucasfilm\\'s \"Games Group,\" which would go on to become Lucasfilm Games.\\n\\n\\n�We were creating a culture that was designed around innovation,� said Arnold, trying to explain why Lucasfilm Games was able to produce a remarkably diverse array of games -- BallBlazer, Rescue on Fractalus, Habitat and the like -- in a relatively short span of time.\\n\\n\\n�One of the important constraints we had was that we weren�t working with Star Wars,� said Arnold. �We didn\\'t have to play in that universe -- we got to do our own creation, and we were literally the only group � outside of George � within the Lucasfilm company that got to make up new stories and call them Lucasfilm.�\\n\\n\\n�George had simple rules for us: �Stay small, be the best, and don�t lose any money.��\\n\\n\\nTo hear Arnold tell it, those rules were liberating because they inspired the team to experiment with new ideas. The culture of Lucasfilm Games that Arnold remembers was much akin to an indie film studio � the team wanted to build things that people wanted to buy, but they also wanted to make something artful.\\n\\n\\nChip Morningstar served as a designer and programmer at Lucasfilm Games, most notably as project lead for the early graphical online game Habitat.\\n\\n\\n�One of our principles was that we never did anything with the company�s own money � we had to get someone else to pay for it,� said Morningstar, who went on to explain how early Lucasfilm Games staffers would keep an �idea file� full of game pitches that would be plundered whenever representatives of other companies would visit in order to �bask in the glow of Star Wars.\\n\\n\\nWhen a representative from Quantum Link came through one day, Morningstar remembers pitching him on the idea of making something like Habitat. The guy went for it, and Morningstar suddenly found himself responsible for leading development on what would prove to be a groundbreaking online game.\\n\\n\\n�It was kind of radically egalitarian,� said Morningstar. �Almost all developers� titles were �designer/programmer� at Lucasfilm Games, and everyone was entitled to contribute.�\\n\\n\\nRon Gilbert, a veteran developer known for his work on critically-acclaimed games like Maniac Mansion and The Cave, shared his own memories of the relatively flat operating hierarchy',\n",
       " 'Tanaka, and the second part is a series of the aforementioned interviews in segments called \"Portrait of an Otaku\".The animation first:Kubo and Tanaka were college friends; Kubo the typical Gary Stu kind of guy- tennis team, has a beautiful girlfriend, scholar, and everything seems right in his life, except he\\'s rather bored. He meets up with Tanaka by chance in an elevator, and from that fateful reunion on is slowly drawn into the Otaku lifestyle of making fanfiction magazines, garage kits (modified figurines), and eventually full on anime and video games in an attempt to become the OTAKING- King of the Otakus!After rising to the top, Kubo and Tanaka get screwed, and then have to decide what it was that was really important to them- the grubbing, hand to mouth lifestyle of being an artist and original creator, or selling out and making all the money. There\\'s only one true path for the Otaking, and that\\'s to take it beyond the stars.----The pacing is broken up by the interviews, but the narrative is both engaging and humorous, along with providing a very loose version of how Gainax was started, and their goals of shooting for the stars, both in animation and in business practices. It\\'s very interesting to see how Otaku no Video inspired later works, and drew from the doujinshi (amateur produced works) that put Gainax on the map. Real life science fiction conventions Daicon 3 and 4 (1981, 1983) are explored, which Gainax also produced shorts for. Other character stylings and symbols seen in later works also make appearances, like Kamina\\'s glasses on a building, robots from Gunbuster, and more.-----Portrait of an Otaku:Through a series of live interviews, the movie also explores the lives and disparate interests of those who call themselves Otaku. Garage Kit Otaku, Military Otaku, Anime and Manga, Fanzines, Cosplay enthusiasts, and Fan Video Otaku, and even an art thief are all shown, and asked series of questions that either mock their interests and lifestyle, or that give some insight into what it is that drives them to their obsession.While it\\'s believed that the people interviewed were either Gainax employees themselves (who created their studio to put a name behind their amateur original works, and thereby personifying some of these stereotypes), some of it is plainly staged. Hideaki Anno himself is shown as a Hentai-game addict, even. Typically, the faces and voices are censored, so it\\'s still unknown who some of them are. It\\'s interesting in that they\\'re making fun of Otaku, and at the same time themselves, because that\\'s how Gainax started out: geeks making their own originals to hawk at conventions.The portrait section also provides some hilarious statistics on what Otaku are interested in, and how different groups see different themes. A foreigner was also intereviewed, and it was stated that some 50% of those surveyed come to Japan solely out of anime and manga fandom, and the other half either \"like\" or \"are not opposed\" to it. A fanzine convention survey of 100 Otaku revealed that only 15% of them had cosplayed, and an overwhelming 60% had not. Of those 15 that responded yes, the \"Otaku who did cosplay tended to be repeat offenders\".Another survey included those who \"talk to themselves\", of which the overwhelming majority with 70% did.-----There\\'s also a deep sociological background to Otaku culture; stemming from how a more collectivist culture like Japan operates vs an intensely individualistic one like the US. \"The nail that sticks out gets hammered\" they say, and to a point, it\\'s true. In a collectivist culture, the ideal person fits in with their group, their family, their society, and don\\'t express their individualism much when around others. In private, they can be a night and day different person.The Otaku have long been branded as \"no life losers\", and in a sense shunned from their culture as they\\'re perceived \"deviant\", no different from the US, really. People with anime and manga obsession, people obsessed with doomsday preparation, zombie fanatics, etc.-all these groups share a common thread in that they\\'re on the fringe of \\'normative\\' society. In that, they find a bond together, and create their own subculture outside of the norms.For anyone who\\'s interested in the Otaku culture, this half mockumentary is a great video for insight into what it was like back in the day, even if it\\'s somewhat parodical. In all honesty, what they portray satirically here is not far from the truth, neither in 1991 nor in 2015. There are tons of people out there like the ones shown in this movie, that are obsessive enthusiasts of different fandoms, and though their interests may be broad, they\\'re all bound by a label',\n",
       " 'The demonstration of the new robot\\'s abilities. Credit: \\u200bRT/YouTube.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the Russian military unveiled a prototype of its new combat robot, designed to look and act like our favorite science fiction androids. Vladimir Putin himself traveled to the town of Klimovsk, where the robot was developed by the Russian Defense Institute \"Tochmash,\" to watch the robo-soldier in action.\\n\\nPutin looked on as the robot fired five gunshots, and drove an ATV cautiously around a snowy track with a random fire in the background. But despite the sophistication of the android, the Russian President seemed visibly bored by its antics. Perhaps he was imagining something more in the vein of the Terminator, and less like an anemic RoboCop, or a droid you might find at a Jawa yard sale. If I was told that I was going to watch a new warrior robot take a quad bike out for a spin, I probably would\\'ve been disappointed how epically unintimidating the end result was, too.\\n\\nIndeed, the cherry on the cake is that this robot wasn\\'t even driving the vehicle autonomously—\\u200bit was operated remotely by a Tochmash engineer. Unless further details were left out of Russia Today\\'s video coverage of the unveiling, it\\'s basically a glorified remote control toy car. But with guns.\\n\\nAccording to Sputnik News, \\u200bfuture versions of the robot will be able to provide emergency first aid, assist in the construction of infrastructure, and travel over difficult terrains. The project is part of a larger Russian initiative to revitalize the military with \"autonomous tanks, unmanned vehicles, and other weapons one won\\'t be ashamed of in the 21st century,\" \\u200baccording to Russia Today.\\n\\nThat all sounds interesting, if it does come to fruition. But for now, Putin\\'s \"meh\" expression pretty much sums up our feelings about the terrifying new robot soldier that appears to drive at a stultifying four miles an hour.',\n",

       " 'By Bernard Hickey\\n\\nPrime Minister John Key has given the strongest signal yet that he expects the Reserve Bank to announce new measures to limit lending to rental property investors as the Government grapples with double-digit housing inflation and the Reserve Bank faces having to cut interest rates again.\\n\\nKey told reporters before Question Time in Parliament he expected the Reserve Bank to take action sooner rather than later as he responded to questions about figures from Barfoot and Thompson and QV showing rental property investors jumping in and house prices accelerating ahead of an expected third round of Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) controls.\\n\\nHe was asked about what the Reserve Bank was considering, given it announced earlier on Tuesday that Deputy Governor Grant Spencer would deliver a speech on Thursday evening that covered the areas of macro-prudential policy and the housing market.\\n\\nSpencer and Governor Graeme Wheeler signaled on June 9 they were considering the potential for a third round of LVR controls before the end of the year \"or before that.\" See our article on that here.\\n\\nSpeculation has intensified in recent weeks that the Reserve Bank could either lower the current 70% LVR threshold for rental property investors in Auckland, and/or extend it to the rest of the country.\\n\\nKey said he did not know what Spencer would say in the speech, but that the Government had been having regular discussions with the Reserve Bank about the issue.\\n\\n\\'They should get on with it\\'\\n\\nAsked about Spencer\\'s planned speech and whether the Reserve Bank needed to introduce a third round of controls on investors, he said: \"Yeah, I think there is a responsibility for the Reserve Bank to have a look at the question around investors. We\\'ve had those discussions with the Reserve Bank.\"\\n\\n\"They can control that part of the market and I don\\'t know exactly what he\\'ll say on Thursday, but certainly the government\\'s perspective I think has been that having a look at that might make some sense,\" he said.\\n\\nAsked if the Reserve Bank could extend the Auckland investor restrictions across the country and/or further lower the threshold in Auckland, Key said: \"My own view is that he should make some movements in that area, yes.\"\\n\\nAsked if he was optimistic about the Reserve Bank further tightening those restrictions, he said: \"Not on Thursday, but over time, potentially.\"\\n\\nKey said he had had broad ranging discussions with the Reserve Bank.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a double edged sword, of course. You need investors in the market to make sure there is rental property, but my sense is that potentially one of the risks is that you have got people buying properties at the moment, borrowing more money, but fearful that the Reserve Bank is going to move,\" he said.\\n\\n\"So if they are going to make changes, probably better they should get on with it.\"\\n\\nKey was then asked if it was an issue all over the country or just in Auckland.\\n\\n\"It depends a little bit. It\\'s in those high growth areas. Actually if you look at the QV data, Auckland did go up, obviously, rapidly, but places like Tauranga and Hamilton were faster.\"\\n\\nAsked if he preferred the Reserve Bank should focus on Auckland or all of the country, he said: \"They should look at those high growth areas.\"',\n",

(Only six -- Hank Bauer, El Tappe, Frank Robinson, Joe Torre, Don Kessinger and Pete Rose -- have occupied the latter role since 1960.)\\n\\nBy the 1940s managers Connie Mack of the Philadelphia A\\'s and Burt Shotton of the Brooklyn Dodgers wore street clothes long after their playing days had expired, but they were the exceptions.\\n\\nPresently, MLB\\'s only official rule regarding the matter is 1.11 (a) (1) and states: \"All players on a team shall wear uniforms identical in color, trim and style, and all players\\' uniforms shall include minimal six-inch numbers on the back.\"\\n\\nNote that managers are never specifically referenced.\\n\\nWhen asked about the discrepancy, MLB released this statement: \"The tradition of managers and coaches wearing uniforms has long been an accepted practice and well understood, even without formal rules being in place.\"\\n\\nMLB managers seem agreeable toward the understood rule regarding uniforms.\\n\\n\"It\\'s better than wearing a suit,\" White Sox manager Robin Ventura says.\\n\\nBut it\\'s also a bit perplexing, considering the clubs\\' trainers wear short-sleeve polo shirts and khaki pants, and their job of working on players\\' injured joints seems as physically taxing -- if not more so -- as any manager\\'s.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a lot of work to put on the whole uniform,\" says Orioles All-Star closer Zach Britton, \"especially for the manager when there\\'s no need for you to go sliding or diving.\"\\n\\n***\\n\\nWhen eccentric Braves owner Ted Turner made the brazen move to manage his team for one game on May 11, 1977, he crammed a chunk of chaw in his cheek and sported jersey No. 27.\\n\\n\"He had never been a player, never been a coach, never worn a uniform, but for the day that he was manager, he was outfitted with a uniform,\" Thorn says. \"That tells you something about the strength of the tradition.\"\\n\\nSome managers dress like their players -- down to the very last detail. Showalter wears stirrups. Bobby Cox wore a cup and spikes for every game.\\n\\n\"You never see a manager wearing actual cleats … It was hilarious,\" says Adam LaRoche who played for Cox while with the Braves from 2004-2006. \"It\\'s just his style.

       " 'Plus/Minus Functions and Quadra Values by Victor Gulenko\\n\\n.\\n\\n+/- signs have seen various interpretations and changes over time. Please refer to this article for further information: http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin...unctions-Eglit Discussion thread - http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin...042#post584042 Original article - http://socioniko.net/ru/articles/quadra-soc-psy.html Notes: Remember. These are +/- descriptions. They\\'re not descriptions of the full functions, which are much, much more complex. They only describe how one Reinin dichotomy (process/result) alters the function -- one out of a possible fifteen. That\\'s right! Just one stinking dichotomy. So don\\'t complain that they\\'re simplistic descriptions of your personality, because they\\'re not meant to convey very much about you anyway.ALPHA-Fe= minimization or avoidance of negative emotions, prevention of quarrels, scandals, and other situations causing emotional instability, which is valued as more important than creation of positive emotional effect.-Ti= global structural logic. Systematic analysis is the instrument that they use in understanding the world. They are primarily interested in the universal laws that govern its workings. To that end, all traditions, conventions and restrictions are discarded. Everything is subjected to analysis, redefinition, analogies. Their main goal that they are pursuing is the creation of a comprehensive, breathtaking, singular picture of the world. The idea of unity, reasonableness and the fairness in all things permeates their vision completely.+Si= positive feelings of comfort. They cannot effectively realize their potential if their lifestyle is full of hardships. Style of activity is characterized by relaxation, freedom, by conveniences. Relations with the external environment, where their activities unfold, must be friendly and pleasant. Their groups are always comfortable, relaxed as if at home, and never rough or eccentric.+Ne= promising ideas. In this quadra, which can be attributed the element of air, there are frequent talks about the future, the unexplored and unknown possibilities. They may seem to be incorrigible dreamers. And this is so: they look out further than anyone, beyond the horizon, they put forward \"crazy\" theories and discuss them with pleasure. Some of these theories, however, are destined to have long lives, so long that they will outlast their creators.BETA+Fe= maximization of positive emotions. Even small doses are enjoyed. Against the backdrop of the dramatic, turbulent emotions that always accompany this quadra, every small occurrence deserving a positive response is seen as an occasion for joy and uplifts their spirits.+Ti= organizational logic. They have a developed sense of duty, citizenship, loyalty to the elected project. It is therefore the most disciplined and organized quadra that knows how to quickly rally its forces in the event of imminent danger or emergency situations.-Se= minimization of weaknesses, i.e. steadfastness in the struggle against deprivation and resistance against the enemy. In this quadra, the force of will is an indispensable condition for effective operation. Persistence, determination, endurance and firmness are always the supreme authority.-Ni= desire to bypass danger. They aim t avoid previously committed mistakes. In their groups, experience, skill, know-how, sophistication are highly valued. They feel confident in extreme situations.GAMMA-Fi= minimization of negative relationships. This element is critical of evil. They desire to get away from bad people and poor relationships, and to protect themselves from enemies and adversaries. They want to minimize negative experiences, because as we know from psychoanalysis, all extruded problems are liable to generate an emotional reaction one way or another, with a physical cost for the purification of the subconscious.-Te= business logic of risk and entrepreneurship. For them it is characteristic to reject that which is useless, insignificant, mundane. This aspect is valued as more important than accumulation and rational consumption. Gammas successfully operate in environments of economic scarcity, where in order to survive it is necessary to use something that may appear useless at first glace, but which is present in abundance.+Se= durability and resistance. This quadra is well capable of defending itself and its position. For them power is not easy to acquire, as to do this they must resist the volitional Beta quadra. However, once it is seized, they can hold on to it despite all attempts at restoration. Protectiveness, ability to defend themselves against all force, ability to keep that which was acquired - these are the principles that they respect. This quadra can be called the quadra of criticism and reforms. In contrast to the \\'fire\\' Beta quadra, which is oriented primarily politically, this quadra is oriented more socially.+Ni= constraining their hot temper, these sociotypes prefer to advance gradually into the future, though they may sharply reject obsolete ideas, criticizing past mistakes.

       " 'Chris Froome is certain he is on track to contend for a fourth Tour de France victory next month despite his not managing to win the Critérium du Dauphiné, traditionally his warm-up race for La Grande Boucle. The Team Sky leader won the eight-day race in France each time before his Tour victories in 2013, 2015 and 2016 but this year could finish only fourth to the Dane Jakob Fuglsang.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not the superstitious type, to think that winning the Dauphiné is a precursor to winning the Tour,\" Froome says. \"It\\'s certainly good for the morale and the confidence to win your last race before the Tour but I don\\'t think it\\'s a prerequisite.\"\\n\\nChris Froome\\'s Tour de France win puts him among greats | William Fotheringham Read more\\n\\nThe 32-year-old Briton added that. if he was not at his peak in June, that might be explained by the need to keep his powder dry for later in the season. \"I have been very light on race days this year – going into the Dauphiné I was on 19 race days – but that has been a conscious decision to keep me fresher for what\\'s to come.\\n\\n\"Potentially with the Tour and the Vuelta a España afterwards it could be a busy summer of racing. It\\'s worked in the past going into this part of the season fresher. I feel the Dauphiné was just what I needed in terms of intensity and it was a very intense Dauphiné – especially the back end of it. When we hit the mountains it was a full-on race and it will have moved me on, condition-wise, a lot.\"\\n\\nUnlike in other years Froome has yet to score his first win of the season but that barely seems to worry him. However, he professes fascination with a radical route for this year\\'s race that includes nine potential sprint stages and only two genuine mountain-top finishes, at Peyragudes in the Pyrenees and the Col d\\'Izoard in the Alps, with a third, smaller one at Plateau des Belles Filles in eastern France.\\n\\n\"I genuinely think this year\\'s Tour route presents the biggest challenge to me that I\\'ve faced in my career to date. It\\'s an open course and the level of my rivals is higher than it has ever been. It will be a much closer race in July, more hard fought than we\\'ve seen in the last few years. I think what strikes me most is the lack of time-trial kilometres.\"\\n\\nThere are only two time trials in the Tour this year: 13 kilometres on the opening stage, this Saturday in Düsseldorf, and 22 kilometres in Marseille on the final Saturday three weeks later. That is a massive contrast with the 1990s and the noughties when there might be two stages against the watch of up to 50 or 60 kilometres, a prologue time trial and possibly a team time trial.\\n\\nChris Froome wins third Tour de France in Paris – as it happened Read more\\n\\nIt follows a recent trend, as the 2015 Tour won by Froome had an even smaller amount of individual time-trialling. This year, however, the race is short of obvious set-piece stages, as Froome notes. \"It\\'s not as if it\\'s been made up for with mountain-top finishes, it\\'s also very light on those. It\\'s a very open race. Of course there are some mountain-top finishes – the Izoard stage, for example, that\\'s going to be a straightforward general classification race up to almost 2,500m. You\\'ve got a very open course, almost begging for riders to be more aggressive, to take opportunities to create situations on the road that will lead to exciting racing.\\n\\n\"It will be interesting to see if that happens or if it\\'s a more controlled race, because the guys are watching and waiting because there are so few typical general classification days, the [favourites] will get their teams to ride and wait for those rather than going for it. It will be interesting to see who is going there with what kind of tactics.\"\\n\\nThat is far from the only source of speculation. Froome will race this year\\'s Tour against the backdrop of an eight-month long investigation by UK Anti-Doping into allegations of possible wrongdoing at Team Sky in the wake of the Jiffy bag saga. That culminated in the revelation that the team had acquired 55 doses of the corticosteroid triamcinolone between 2010 and 2013, with no paper trail to explain what it was used for. Triamcinolone is banned, unless used under certain conditions with a therapeutic use exemption, and is known to enhance performance.\\n\\nThere have also been reports of dissent within Team Sky over the affair, with the role of the Sky principal, Sir',\n",
       " 'ESPN college basketball analyst Andy Katz, right, broadcasts courtside. (Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press)\\n\\nFor the second year in a row, Disney is poised to have another \"Star Wars\" megahit on its hands with the company on track to sell $130 million in U.S. pre-release tickets for next week\\'s \"Rogue One.\"\\n\\nBut no matter how well it performs at the box office, the film\\'s success may be overshadowed by Disney investors\\' rising alarm about another part of the Magic Kingdom: ESPN, which is shedding viewers in record numbers.\\n\\nESPN was thrust into the spotlight in November when the ratings company Nielsen predicted the sports juggernaut would lose 621,000 cable subscribers that month. Nielsen estimated the sports network would lose another 555,000 subscribers in December.\\n\\nThe staggering losses have led to calls by analysts for Disney to spin off or sell the beleaguered network, which has lost 9 million subscribers in three years, according to company filings.\\n\\nThe challenges ahead are not unique to ESPN. The pay-TV industry as a whole has seen many consumers trim back their cable subscriptions in favor of online video services — or, fed up with the rising cost of TV, forgo cable altogether.\\n\\nWith YouTube TV on the horizon and other streaming services becoming more affordable, it may be time to cancel your cable service. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\\n\\n\"There\\'s an underlying theme of the bundle being the problem,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. \"People don\\'t want to pay for what they don\\'t want to get.\"\\n\\nBut ESPN remains one of the world\\'s most profitable sports networks, and its struggles raise troubling questions about the entire TV ecosystem. Long considered the linchpin of the traditional bundle, live sports is often what compels viewers to stay with their cable provider rather than cut the cord. But as more consumers defect in the face of growing cable bills, what is happening at ESPN could end up affecting channels up and down the lineup. And for Disney, one of the world\\'s most powerful media companies, the problems at ESPN risk dampening the success of its other brands, such as Star Wars, Marvel Studios and Pixar.\\n\\n\"Most of the Disney empire is healthy, but its stock price has been suffering to the downside because we have weak subscriber growth at ESPN,\" said Laura Martin, a media analyst at Needham and Co. \"So that weak subscriber growth is a shadow over the whole empire.\"\\n\\nESPN and its siblings, such as ABC, account for the biggest chunk of Disney\\'s business by far, pulling in $24 billion in revenue this fiscal year. The company\\'s next biggest segment, theme parks, made $17 billion.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t that long ago that observers were calling ESPN \"the most valuable media property in the United States,\" estimating its value at 20 times that of the New York Times Co. and five times the size of Rupert Murdoch\\'s News Corp.\\n\\nSince hitting a high of nearly $122 in the summer of 2015, the stock has dropped about 14 percent; that includes a 5 percent rally this week.\\n\\nAlthough ESPN disputed Nielsen\\'s methodology, the ratings firm ultimately stood by its numbers.\\n\\n[John Skipper is steering ESPN through turbulent times]\\n\\nA spokesman for ESPN referred questions to the network\\'s parent company. Disney did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\\n\\nLast month, in an interview with CNBC, Disney chief executive Bob Iger said he remains confident in ESPN. \"We think the long-term revenues are going to be just fine,\" he said.\\n\\nESPN is hardly the only programming company facing long-term pressure as consumers increasingly opt for Internet-based video streaming that undercuts the legacy cable bundle. TV providers such as Dish Network and AT&T have raced to offer packages of traditional channels as Internet-based apps; the outlook for those efforts is still uncertain, but some analysts say ESPN faces a steeper challenge than most because of the rapidly rising cost to the network of acquiring sports broadcasting rights.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s face it - sports has changed,\" said Jim Hill, a longtime Disney analyst. \"It\\'s gotten so expensive ... it\\'s a scary time all around the barn right now for sports, and that\\'s another thing that Disney\\'s eyeballing.\"\\n\\nThe rights to broadcast live sports cost cable companies a collective $16 billion last year, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers — up 50 percent from 2011. That figure is expected to grow another 30 percent by 2020.\\n\\nBetween the rising content costs and the defection of consumers, some analysts have proposed that Disney spin off its ESPN unit. This week, Steve Cahall, a media analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the move would allow investors to gain a better understanding of Disney\\'s fundamental profitability. He added it could earn Disney some cash to invest in its remaining businesses, or make Disney',\n",

The Diamondbacks are 17-7 in extra-inning games.\\n\\nArticle continues below ...\\n\\n\"A lot of the games we played extra innings were because of blown saves,\" reliever Brad Ziegler said. \"But it also says a lot about our offense because there were a lot of games that we came from behind to get to extra innings, too.

       " 'The following UFO photos are from the archives of Lt. Col. Wendelle C. Stevens, and the accompanying details have been reproduced as close to the original sighting report as possible.\\n\\n19 April 1978, Colfax, Wisconsin\\n\\nOn Wednesday 19 April 1978, Mr. S. (name witheld (sic) by specific request) and his girlfriend were driving in the vicinity of Tainter Lake, when they decided to stop and attempt some fishing since most of the ice was already thawed.\\n\\nThey found a spot along the shore where they could do some casting. Mr. S. had also brought along an FM portable radio. They had been at this spot for about a half an hour when the radio began picking up interference. It was then that Mr. S. looked up into the sky, thinking an airplane must be going over-head.\\n\\nAt that point the object \"appeared\" out of the southwest, moving northeast. He and his girlfriend became very excited and frightened. Remembering that they had a camera with them, (an Instamatic) Mr. S. went and got it to take some pictures. He almost dropped it several times trying to get it out of the case. He finally got it out and started to point it at the object when the object suddenly veered off course in their direction and came towards them. They became even more frightened but Mr. S. was determined to get a photograph of the thing!\\n\\nAt that point, the object began to circle them at a high altitude as Mr. S. began taking pictures. The object flew around the area only once and then disappeared into the sunlight. The whole incident lasted about 3 or 4 minutes.\\n\\nMr. S. was hesitant about showing anyone the photos because he was afraid of people thinking the wrong thing. He finally sent a UFO lecturer a copy after attending one of his slide lectures on the UFO subject.\\n\\nMr. S. was unable to determine the size of the object for lack of reference, or how fast it was moving. He did say, however, that it gave off a \"crackling sound\" as it passed around them.\\n\\nFrom personal letter:\\n\\nPhoto #1: Shows the object moments after it veered off its original course. Mr. S. said it slowed down considerably after he took the first picture. He said he had \"the feeling it knew it was being photographed\".\\n\\nPhoto #2: The object is moving slower now as it begins to make its pass. At this point Mr. S. and girlfriend grew apprehensive. Both experienced extreme fear.\\n\\nPhoto #3: The object tilts as it begins a \"roller coaster\" type descent. Mr. S. and friend become increasingly frightened. He has the feeling it is going to \"get them\".\\n\\nPhoto #4: The object has leveled off and is just above the treetop height. It begins moving toward Mr. S. at a slow gliding pace. No sound comes from the object but Mr. S. remembers he left his transistor radio on and it is \"buzzing\" and \"crackling like crazy\".\\n\\nPhoto #5: Mr. S. turns his camera sideways to get this shot of the object as it passes almost directly overhead. At this point Mr. S. experienced a sensation of \"heat\" as well as \"prickling sensation\" around and \"in\" his head and eyes, however Mr. S. stated that he experienced no permenant or temporary after-effects except a bad case of the \"jitters\". This shot was taken while Mr. S. was in a crouched position and remembers falling over on his back afterwards. He said he noticed an \"amber or orange-red light\" underneath in addition to several small lights which would blink on and off erratically for different lengths of time. (See Photograph) He also noticed 4 \"pods\" or \"landing gear\". The bottom appeared to be a \"dull\" black. The shock of falling backwards prevented him from taking any more pictures of the object as it continued overhead.\\n\\nThe object has now climbed back up into the sky as Mr. S. shoots this picture.\\n\\nPhoto #7: Shows the object heading into the sun. At this point it began to pick up speed and soon was lost in the sunlight. Mr. S. took 9 pictures in all, only these 7 turned out.\\n\\nView the: Colfax UFO Case Drawing.\\n\\nPopular Posts:',\n",
       " 'Despite the often chaotic world of professional wrestling, Total Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling has existed as an operating promotion since 2002, while Dixie Carter began serving as President of the company in 2003.\\n\\nBorn in Dallas, Texas in 1964, Carter studied Business Administration at the University of Mississippi, and owned a business focusing primarily on sport and music representation in Nashville before she joined the wrestling business, initially in TNA\\'s marketing and publicity department, before financial turmoil within the organisation saw her help broker a deal which saw her parents, under the Panda Energy banner, buy the company.\\n\\nOver the past decade TNA has continued to survive and has featured many of the greatest names in the history of wrestling, while also giving worldwide publicity to talents who were previously unknown. Speaking to The Independent on the phone from her office in America, Carter began the conversation by talking about the success of Challenge TV\\'s British Bootcamp 2, the reality show which was won by TNA standout Rockstar Spud in its first instalment.\\n\\n\"I\\'m proud of the show, the first season was very successful, our ratings have doubled for this one which is almost unheard of, and there is such a great talent pool from the UK and Ireland.\\n\\n\"I hope this show has given everyone a shot in the arm to raise their game and to define their characters more, because if they really take the process seriously, every single one of those talents should come out better for it.\"\\n\\nOne such talent on the show which has attracted much attention over the course of the show has been Grado, who has become one of Britain\\'s biggest stars in the recent past, stemming from his appearances in Insane Championship Wrestling and his strong YouTube fame. Carter likes what she sees in the comedic Scot, who recently finished in the top six of the show.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a big Grado fan, and I\\'m excited about him, and the other five finalists being on the upcoming UK tour, and there is something about him that I know he will try to steal the spotlight from everybody. He didn\\'t get off to a good start with Al Snow in particular, he felt it was Grado\\'s downfall that he didn\\'t take it seriously enough, that he felt he could funny his way through it, and it really bothered Al, which could have kept him from winning.\"\\n\\nGrado has spoken about possibly facing Snow on the tour, and that is something that has piqued the interest of the TNA President.\\n\\n\"He has been on at me for that to happen, and Al Snow is in as good condition as he has ever been in, he loves stepping into the ring but Grado would have the entire UK with him. Al would take that match very seriously, and he should be prepared.\"\\n\\nTNA has achieved a startling degree of success in the UK, thanks to their flagship television show Impact being aired on Challenge TV, and the company tour yearly in arenas which attract thousands of fans.\\n\\nThis year, all six of the final contestants from British Bootcamp 2, Noam Dar, Kay Lee Ray, Rampage Brown, Dave Mastiff, Mark Andrews and Grado will be appearing on the shows, as well as TNA World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Roode, Magnus, Rockstar Spud, James Storm, MVP and more. The events, in Glasgow, Manchester and London will also all be taped for television, which has excited Carter.\\n\\n\"The UK has been such an integral part of the success that we have had, it gave us an early success story when we needed one with the television ratings, ticket sales and media exposure. Now having British Bootcamp, and the tours getting bigger, I wanted to raise the bar this year and I needed to know from a scheduling standpoint in the US that I could turn the UK shows into TV tapings so I was thrilled to announce that.\\n\\n\"Having the British Bootcamp participants on the shows is great, and I want the fans to get there early, from the time the doors open for it to be a party atmosphere, and to make it fun and special.\"\\n\\nAfter a nine year relationship with Spike TV, TNA has signed a deal to partner with Discovery Communications, and Impact will begin to air on Destination America in January 2015. Despite some wrestling insiders tipping the switch as a backwards move, Carter was positive about the change, and the possibilities that the partnership can bring.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very excited about it, we talked with a lot of networks and at the end it came down to that I was looking for somebody who didn\\'t want to just license a two hour television show, but somebody who wanted to be a true partner. This deal is not just about Impact on a network, and it\\'s not just about being part of a group of networks in the US which are the largest and who have vowed their support, it\\'s about the global reach, and I\\'m very confident we can help Destination America, and be one of the',\n",

       " \"In September 2009 we predicted that average 8GB DIMM prices (DDR2 and DDR3) would reach $565/stick by year end (with DDR3 being higher than DDR2) and at now we're seeing the reversal of fortunes for DDR2. At year end, the average price for benchmark DDR2/DDR3 was $591 retail, with promotional pricing pushing that below$550 as predicted. Today, we're seeing DDR3 begin to overtake DDR2 in the 8GB ECC category, dropping below $510/stick, while DDR2 climbs to $550/stick (promotional, on $625/stick retail.)\\n\\nIn 4GB ECC configurations, DDR2 enjoys only a slight retail advantage (13%) while promotional pricing (likely due to inventory reduction initiatives) are providing a bit better value short term. However, the price gap is only 1/2 the power gap, with DDR3 delivering a greater than 35% reduction in power over its DDR2 equivalent (about $1.25/year/stick at $0.10/kWh). The honeymoon is almost over for DDR2.\\n\\nSOLORI's Take: With strong DDR3 demand and short-falls in DDR2 supply (according to DRAMeXchange), the only thing keeping DDR3 prices above DDR2 at this point is demand and inventory. As Q2/2010 introduces a rush of new workstation and server products based on DDR3 systems, the DRAM production ramp will eventually stabilize demand somewhere towards the end of Q3/2010. Meanwhile, technology companies like VMware, Microsoft, Intel and AMD are betting on new infrastructure spending on operating systems, virtualization and hardware refresh to drive-up economic market factors. If the global economic crisis deepens, this anticipated spending spree could be short-lived and its impact shallow.\",\n",
       " \"For a place called Brooklyn Coffee Shop, there is quite an extensive food menu at this new Mills 50 spot.\\n\\nAlso, for a place named after a New York borough, there's a lot of South American influences. Seattle, too. Also Miami.\\n\\nBut that's all explained, at least partially, on the business's website. Owners Daniel and Patricia Carvalho lived in Seattle and New York but moved to Brazil, where, in 2010, they opened the first Brooklyn Coffee Shop as a paean to Seattle's favorite liquid and Brooklyn's neighborhood bistros. That location in Curitiba and a second one there continue, though its Facebook page makes a lot of references to Orlando.\\n\\nThe Orlando BCS takes the space most recently occupied by Restaurant Ash, which was also the original Funky Monkey Wine Co. So there's a kitchen to be put to use.\\n\\nThey fire it up in the morning for breakfast fare such as Shakshuka, house-made doughnuts and a variety of dishes with eggs, including empanadas.\\n\\nIt continues through lunch with the morning menu available plus a variety of salads, sandwiches and other empanadas.\\n\\nIt's clear that empanadas are a specialty, so I had the Pastel de Carne when I stopped in for a late lunch. It was filled with lots of shredded brisket, seasoned with garlic, onions and chili spicing. The turnover-like device had a wonderfully flaky crust, at least on the top. When I picked it up I found the bottom part quite moist. This apparently was from the fatty brisket, so it just added flavor. Lots and lots of flavor. It was even better when dipped in the mildly spicy chimichurri.\\n\\nI also had the Bauru sandwich. Bauru is a traditional Brazilian sandwich that is usually made with roast beef and melted cheese, typically mozzarella. For some reason -- perhaps in an attempt to Brooklynize it? -- here it is made with Canadian bacon and swiss cheese, unmelted, along with tomato and sliced pickles. What makes this odder is that the restaurant's website says this sandwich is made with brisket. And since we know that brisket is available for the making of empanadas, why Canadian bacon?\\n\\nWhatever. It was a very good sandwich, with plenty of meat, and a buttery taste in the toasted bread. I don't think it quite warranted the $8 fee, especially served solo. (The $3.50 charge for the empanada was fair.)\\n\\nAnd then there's the coffee. It's a bit strange that a place named Brooklyn would specify Americano as a choice. I'd think that would be the default. The beans are from Panther Coffee in Miami. This would have been a great chance to bring in the Seattle connection, or even the South American angle.\\n\\nMy $2.50 cup of Americano, served in a Christmas themed mug, was only so-so.\\n\\nLittle seems to have been done with the interior other than moving some furniture around. To wit, a hightop communal table that was near the front window is now in the back of the restaurant. The Edison lights that hung low over the table remain, below head level. Screws and hangers where photos and other accouterments of the previous occupant used to be are still in the walls. Some sprucing up may be in order.\\n\\nBrooklyn Coffee Shop is at 912 N. Mills Ave., Orlando. It is open for breakfast and lunch daily, with dinner hours to be announced soon. A brunch menu is served on Saturday and Sunday. The phone number is 407-704-1757\",\n",

Players gather at those hotspots to lure creatures they capture and then pit against each other in virtual battles. It was created by Niantic Corp.\\n\\nPraised by some, including Crocco who said \"anything that gets you off the sofa and outside and moving around is good,\" the game has also stirred a cloud of controversy over safety.\\n\\nOn the safety side, a Toronto comic was recently fined for walking on TTC subway tracks while shooting a video about the game; in July police in Auburn NY, near Rochester, reported a man crashed his car while playing the game and police in the Belgian port city of Antwerp issued a warning about the potential dangers of pedestrians playing the game.

       " 'The bound T: Mul does not imply that the result of the binary operator is also of type T . The result type is an associated type of this trait: Output .\\n\\nThe other issue is that at some point in time the operator traits switched from pass-by-referece to pass-by-value. In generic code this can be a bit of a pain in the butt (for now at least) because these operators consume their operands unless you also require the types to be Copy .\\n\\nJust for completeness (in case you don\\'t like to require Copy ), let me add some information about a possible alternative direction.\\n\\nFor the sake of generic code, authors of \"numeric types\" are encouraged to provide additional non-consuming implementations of these operator traits so that you don\\'t need Copy or Clone . For example, the standard library already provides the following implementations:\\n\\nf64 implements Mul< f64> f64 implements Mul<&f64> &f64 implements Mul< f64> &f64 implements Mul<&f64>\\n\\nwith each implementation having f64 as Output type.

For example: T: Mul2 could imply T: Mul<T> + Mul<&T> and &T: Mul<T> + Mul<&T> . But at the time of writing this, the Rust compiler does not seem able to handle this. At least I could not successfully compile the following code:\\n\\nuse std::ops::Mul; pub trait Mul2 where Self: Mul<Self, Output=Self>, Self: for<\\'a> Mul<&\\'a Self, Output=Self>, for<\\'a> &\\'a Self: Mul<Self, Output=Self>, for<\\'a,\\'b> &\\'a Self: Mul<&\\'b Self, Output=Self> {} impl<T> Mul2 for T where T: Mul<T, Output=T>, T: for<\\'a> Mul<&\\'a T, Output=T>, for<\\'a> &\\'a T: Mul<T, Output=T>, for<\\'a,\\'b> &\\'a T: Mul<&\\'b T, Output=T> {} fn cube<T: Mul2>(x: &T) -> T { x * x * x } fn main() { let c = cube(&2.3); println!(\"Hello, world! {}\", c) }\\n\\nI think it\\'s safe to say that things will improve in this area.

I've never had much luck with steel fish tape. These are just the right amount flexible, and a good length. I personally haven't found the glow feature useful so far. The bullnose tip tends to come unscrewed, easy to lose it in the wall as I did. They don't sell replacements of those, apparently. I ended up drilling carefully through the end of one of the rods, which is working well.\\n\\nRated 5 out of 5 by Coon from Klein Glow Rod Set As a veteran electrician, I have used various brands of glow rods from different companies and the ones that I have found to be the best are the ones made by Klein Tools. They are durable as well as flexable and hold up well on jobsites. They even come with a convient tube to be carried in from job site to jobsite.\\n\\nRated 5 out of 5 by Sparky from Great set of rods. Pro electrician here These are great rods as with any of the Klein products. I am a professional commercial electrician and these hold up extremely well as well as some of my other Klein tools I have had for years. It is the industry standard. To the gentleman giving this product 2 stars, you do not run rods through a conduit you should run a flexible fiberglass snake or a metal snake provided no wires are in the conduit that may have power so shut power off before doing so and use wire lube. You sound like the type of person that should not be doing the work in the first place so don't rate a product low because you are going beyond the limitations of the product and using it for other than what it was designed for.\\n\\nRated 2 out of 5 by Wile from glow rod This product worked as expected, but as some of the other reviewers mentioned one of the rods splintered on the first use. I would have expected that if I was trying to bend the sections too sharp or putting too much force on them, but in this case it was a fairly gentle bend and I was trying to be careful and not putting too much pressure on it. The other two sections still look brand new and it did the job as i mentioned. It was just a fair amount of money spent for something that only lasted one use.\\n\\nRated 4 out of 5 by C7882 from The New Glorod If you have the older version the difference you will see is the that the newer version is a little thicker in diameter and also has the splinter guard feature.\\n\\nRated 5 out of 5 by noonie from great Worked perfectly.

       " 'Philadelphia DA Seth Williams (left) has slammed Pa. AG Kathleen Kane\\n\\nWhy did the AG drop a case that exposed Democratic corruption?\\n\\nProsecutors almost never go to war against each other. But in Pennsylvania, Democratic attorney general Kathleen Kane is being brutally criticized by Seth Williams, Philadelphia\\'s district attorney and a fellow Democrat. Williams is upset that last year one of Kane\\'s first acts in office was to decline to prosecute four Philadelphia state legislators and other government officials. In a sting operation, all had been caught accepting cash or Tiffany jewelry in exchange for votes or favors. Kane, who is white, has defended herself, saying that the investigation was badly managed and tainted by racism. She claims the criticism comes from what she calls the \"Good Ol\\' Boys Club.\" Williams, who is African American, has shot back: \"I have seen racism. I know what it looks like. This isn\\'t it.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n#ad#The sting operation followed pretty much the same playbook as the federal Abscam investigation of the 1970s. Begun in 2010, the Philly probe was conducted under Kane\\'s three immediate predecessors as attorney general, and it resulted in more than 400 hours of video and audio recordings. Tyron B. Ali, a lobbyist originally from Trinidad, served as the undercover agent; after he was charged with fraud, he agreed to wear a wire in exchange for lenient treatment. Word of his cash offers eventually got around and prompted some elected officials to call him first. \"Sources with knowledge of the sting said the investigation made financial pitches to both Republicans and Democrats, but only Democrats accepted the payments,\" the Philadelphia Inquirer reported last week.\\n\\nAttorney General Kane inherited the investigation when she took office in January 2013. She told the Inquirer that she stopped it without filing any charges because it was \"poorly conceived, badly managed, and tainted by racism.\" She quoted Claude Thomas, the chief investigator in the case, as saying he had been ordered to target \"only members of the General Assembly\\'s Black Caucus\" and to ignore \"potentially illegal acts by white members.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn response, Williams issued an angry statement and penned an op-ed in Sunday\\'s Inquirer. \"The notion that they would target anyone based on race is ridiculous,\" Williams said in a statement. \"I am confident they are not racist, and it is regrettable that the attorney general would casually throw around such an explosive accusation.\" Thomas, who is also African American, now works for Williams and denies he ever made such a statement.\\n\\nWhat is clear is just how damning some of the collected evidence is. The Inquirer reported this exchange between Ali, the lobbyist, and state representative Vanessa Brown:\\n\\nAli went to Brown\\'s office and handed her an envelope with $2,000, according to people who have reviewed a transcript of a tape Ali made on that day. As Brown accepted the money, they said, she put it in her purse and said: \"Yo, good looking and Ooowee. . . . Thank you twice.\" After he gave Brown the money, Ali urged her to vote against a bill that would require voters to show identification at the polls, the sources said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nKane\\'s supporters say that federal law-enforcement officials she consulted believed the probe had suffered from a lack of \"quality control\" and could be viewed as entrapment. \"Is the acceptance of cash alarming? Absolutely,\" one person close to Kane told the Inquirer. \"But you\\'ve got to think: I\\'ve got to try this case.\"\\n\\nIt certainly may have been politically awkward for Kane, as a Democrat, to prosecute only African-American defendants, but a conviction on something should have been a slam dunk. Even if prosecutors couldn\\'t prove a quid pro quo, it is illegal for politicians to accept payments to enrich themselves and also illegal not to report the income. Further, the prosecutors in this case have a sterling track record in securing convictions against the leadership of both parties in the legislature, winning 21 convictions in the 2010 \"Bonusgate\" scandal, which involved illegal payments to legislative staffers who performed political work. All of those convicted were white.\\n\\nKane has declined to answer detailed questions about why she dropped the investigation. Her critics, she says, are \"playing political games to discredit me in order to fulfill their own selfish and improper agenda.\" When she met with Inquirer editors last Thursday, she brought her personal attorney and on his advice declined to answer any questions after the meeting. Her attorney says she may file a defamation suit against the paper, a ploy frequently used by public figures to intimidate journalists.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWilliams says he is tired of Kane\\'s \"escalating excuses.\" He points out that when she took office, the files on the probe were with federal prosecutors who hadn\\'t yet concluded whether they wanted to pursue their own case. \"All she had to do was leave the investigation in the hands',\n",

       " 'DAMASCUS, Syria — During the second part of a lengthy interview with Al-Monitor in Damascus, a senior Syrian official said that the reality on the ground, the power balance and the military developments in the field were important, and in this regard, the Syrian authorities were content and reassured.\\n\\nThe official, who requested anonymity, started by analyzing the Syrian map: \"Each line extending from our southern border to Aleppo is under the control of Syrian troops. The militants received overwhelming blows in Homs and Qalamoun. Today in Aleppo, any military expert understands the meaning of controlling the central prison and the air force intelligence site in the city. Everybody recognizes that Aleppo is almost militarily fallen. Of course, cleansing it of militants and terrorists may need time. But the battle there, according to military battlefield logic, has already been decided and its results are clear.\"\\n\\nIn response to claims that the regime\\'s opponents have provided the government a great service with their behavior and mistakes, he smiled, saying, \"This is absolutely true. Suffice it to mention two things: first, their collaboration with Israel and their openness to several contacts with it. That really helped us in our media battle in the Arab world. Second, and more importantly, the significant dominance by extremists and terrorist groups over those forces.\"\\n\\nAl-Monitor asked about allegations that the regime released fundamentalist prisoners to facilitate the formation of these groups. The Syrian official answered calmly: \"It is true that a number of fundamentalists were released as a result of amnesty decrees for prisoners by the leadership in Syria during the years of strife. But the domination of extremist groups on the armed groups and their aspiration to control Syria preceded any act by us. Don\\'t forget that the battle with these extremist groups began more than 30 years ago. It didn\\'t break out in 2011. [It broke out] before the conflict [in our region] turned into open military battles. [Al-Qaeda leader] Ayman al-Zawahri was clear in his recorded message when he raised the slogan, \\'The glory of the East starts in Damascus.\\' …\\n\\n\"Of course, we worked through all media, political and diplomatic means, to expose the extremist danger on us and on all our surroundings and the world. This is part of our natural and legitimate response to the terrorist plot. You only need to read the message by Zawahri to an extremist group that he disagreed with, namely, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). He told them that one of the reasons why he disagreed with them is that they came out into the open. Al-Qaeda wanted to keep its battle secret until it was strong and could gain control. This is proof that the first way to fight them is to reveal their true image and highlight their presence and their danger, and that\\'s what we did.\"\\n\\nThe official continued, \"It is important now that the war between them has become very fierce, especially after the split between their groups became an expression of the divide between the countries that were sponsoring and funding terrorists in Syria. One battle between two factions, ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, resulted in 1,400 people dead. Remarkably, in this area, they themselves have become aware of their own destiny and where they are headed. It is no coincidence in this context that Zawahri himself, in a message addressed to the battling rival extremist groups in the first week of April [2014], described some ISIS militants killing an Ahrar al-Sham official as a major crime. More importantly, Zawahri compared it to the incident where the Islamic Fighting Group in Algeria assassinated two other Islamic jihadists in 1995. Zawahri concluded, in his message, that what the Islamic Fighting Group did in Algeria that day was \\'the moral death of those groups, which was followed by their material death.\\'\"\\n\\nThe Syrian official smiled at Zawahri\\'s comparison of events in Algeria two decades ago to present-day Syria. The official said, \"By making this comparison, al-Qaeda\\'s leader wanted to threaten the terrorists beyond his control with death, as happened in Algeria. But he didn\\'t pay attention, in that he expected the war in Syria to have a similar fate to their war in Algeria. The result there was that all terrorists and extremist groups were defeated and the state won and it is still in place to this day, and this is what will happen in Syria.\"\\n\\nWhat about the recent US escalation and Washington\\'s willingness to boost military aid to the opposition? The Syrian official\\'s face turned more serious. \"A few weeks ago, we agreed with our allies in Russia that a high-level delegation from Moscow would visit Damascus. We were officially informed that the delegation will be headed by the Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov. But two weeks ago, officials in the Russian Embassy in Damascus surprised us by telling us that the date of the visit has been postponed for four days. We asked why. They told us it has to do with changes',\n",

In fact, project leaders participated in 559 meetings with community leaders, local officials and organizations to listen to concerns and fine-tune the route. The company asked for, and received, a tougher federal permitting process at sites along the Missouri River. This more difficult procedure included a mandated review of each water crossing\\'s potential effect on historical artifacts and locations.\\n\\nProtesters claim that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to consult tribal leaders as required by federal law. The record shows that the corps held 389 meetings with 55 tribes. Corps officials met numerous times with leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which initiated the lawsuit and the protests.\\n\\nProtesters claim that the Standing Rock Sioux pursued meetings with an unresponsive Army Corps of Engineers. Court records show that the roles in that story were in fact reversed. The corps alerted the tribe to the pipeline permit application in the fall of 2014 and repeatedly requested comments from and meetings with tribal leaders only to be rebuffed over and over. Tribal leaders ignored requests for comment and canceled meetings multiple times.\\n\\nIn September 2014 alone, the corps made five unsuccessful attempts to meet with Standing Rock Sioux leaders. The next month, a meeting was arranged, but \"when the Corps timely arrived for the meeting, Tribal Chairman David Archambault told them that the conclave had started earlier than planned and had already ended,\" according to a federal judge. At a planned meeting the next month, the tribe took the pipeline off the agenda and refused to discuss it. This stonewalling by tribal leaders continued for a year and a half.\\n\\nTypical of the misinformation spread during the protests is a comment made by Jesse Jackson, who recently joined the activists in North Dakota. He said the decision to reroute the pipeline so that it crossed close to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe\\'s water intake was \"racism.\"\\n\\nHe did not mention, possibly because he did not know, that the company is paying to relocate the tribe\\'s water intake to a new spot 70 miles from the location of the contested pipeline crossing.\\n\\nThe pipeline route was adjusted based on concerns expressed by locals — including other tribal leaders — who met with company and Army Corps of Engineers officials. The court record reveals that the Standing Rock Sioux refused to meet with corps officials to discuss the route until after site work had begun.

       " \"Heroes of Antarctic exploration-past famously include Shackleton, Scott, and Amundsen who raced to the South Pole in search of fame and discovery. They encountered harsh conditions and suffered extreme hardships, cut off from communication with the outside world. It took years of planning, then years of recovery, for these explorers to even begin to understand what they went through – let alone to describe what they discovered.\\n\\nOver one hundred years later, filled with probably just as much excitement and anticipation, a new group of explorers has again journeyed to Antarctica. After years of planning, the Antarctic Peninsula Paleontology Project, or AP3, an international team of scientists, of which I am a part, headed off to probe a new frontier of Antarctic exploration. Our mission was not to discover the South Pole, but to find evidence of ancient life on a continent largely void of anything alive today. Would we really get there? Could I carry my own weight? Was my mom justified in worrying like I was her six-year-old daughter, not a 36-year-old professional paleontologist? These questions, among others ran through my mind, as I got ready to join 11 other paleontologists for this extreme fieldwork experience.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Taking the Zodiac to the shore from the Nathaniel B. Palmer icebreaker ship Photograph: Kerin Claeson\\n\\nThis amazing journey was made possible thanks to a merger of science and technology, of geologists and paleontologists, pilots and professors, seafarers and students, of Mother Nature and Deep Time. With the generous support of the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs, the AP3 was able to venture to the Antarctic to answer questions about life near the end of the Age of Dinosaurs. As the name of our project indicates, we targeted a region of Antarctica known as the Antarctic Peninsula, specifically the islands within the James Ross Island Group.\\n\\n\\nThese islands were once covered by ocean, when non-avian dinosaurs roamed the land, giant marine reptiles swam the seas, and swarms of strange fish schooled along the shores. We know the Antarctic Peninsula was warmer back then, teeming with plant and animal life, yet we know so little about the species that lived there. Therefore, we sought to travel to Antarctica ourselves, to collect data to answer questions about the extinct ecosystems that inhabited the continent during the Late Cretaceous and Early Paleogene. Actually getting there was among the first of the many significant hurdles that the AP3 team would eventually overcome.\\n\\nUnlike Shackleton, who met with unexpectedly formidable sea ice and was to surrender his vessel to a frozen horizon, the AP3 was fully informed of the ice conditions on and around the Peninsula. In 2013 and 2014, there were near record amounts of sea ice surrounding the James Ross Island Group. Those would have been the first two years of our AP3 expedition, supported by the US Antarctic Program research vessel Laurence M. Gould. Warned in advance, however, we knew we were going nowhere and cancelled those field seasons. Fast-forward through two years and lots of negotiations, and we were ready to defy the sea ice via passage on the Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP), a larger ice-breaking vessel equipped with small boat and helicopter support.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The team's campsite in Antarctica Photograph: Kerin Claeson\\n\\nThen (wouldn't you guess it?) 2016 was among the warmest austral summers on record, with little sea ice and extensive exposure of potentially fossil-bearing rock. So, it took AP3 only four years of patient preparation, two days of flights to reach Chile, five days of polar field-camp and preparedness training, and four days of cruising through the Straits of Magellan, Drake Passage, and Weddell Sea before we took a short Zodiac ride to the shore of Vega Island on February 13, 2016. We had made it, and we were ready to science day and night for the next five weeks, on and off the shores of the islands in the James Ross group.\\n\\nOf course we were not done facing the elements: water, earth, wind, but no fire (no wood means no campfires and no marshmallows!). By water, I mostly mean the frozen sort. We were not permitted to traverse over ice, much to the dismay of all my friends and family who honestly hoped we would be the team to actually uncover The Thing. No, we were intent on prospecting and digging for fossils, so regardless of potential safety issues, we simply avoided travel over glaciers. We stuck to exposed rock and soil surfaces, of which there were many, and fortunately for the AP3, most of these areas were filled with fossils peeking out of the earth.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Part of a fossil fish skull recovered this year Photograph: Kerin Claeson\\n\\nWe encountered a lot of frozen ground, which actually was great to work on – that is, until it thawed later in the day and we (well\",\n",

Tax dollars from a special sales tax will pay for $66.4 million dollars of equipment. It will connect police, fire and emergency medical crews on special radio channels when multiple agencies are needed for a natural or manmade emergency.\\n\\nSt. Louis County Public Safety Supervisor Daniel Davis said surrounding counties are in the process of joining the communication effort. The terror attack on September 11, 2001 magnified the old system\\'s shortcomings.\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t have the capability for police, fire and medical to talk to one another,\" Davis explained. \"Now we can supply a radio channel for a particular incident or a tornado. Everybody can speak with one another to give optimal service in the area where it\\'s required.\"\\n\\nThe unified system should reduce the time it takes for commanders on the scene to reach first responders when additional help is needed.\\n\\nA new emergency operations center is now open and the county\\'s outdoor tornado siren system has been upgraded thanks to the special emergency communications sales tax that was approved by voters in 2009.\\n\\nThe operations center includes a new 911 answering and police dispatch facility that is large enough to accommodate countywide dispatching service if that is needed. Forty agencies contract with St. Louis County for dispatching service.\\n\\nNineteen other 911 answering centers exist in St. Louis County. Municipal police departments own and operate the other centers. Some of them offer service to smaller police departments under a contract. St. Louis County provided the upgraded radio equipment to each of those centers.\\n\\nBut each 911 center has its own computer dispatching system. Emergency 911 calls made with cell phones can also produce varying results.\\n\\n\"There are still many cell phones out there using older technology. Those cell phone companies are not able to provide us with exact coordinate information for where the call is originating from,\" Davis said.\\n\\nCell phone users need to give dispatchers their precise location to insure first responders can find them.\\n\\nSt. Louis County is in the process of upgrading the 911 system but cell phone owners and their service providers must also improve their technology. \"The next generation 911 will certainly allow us a little better ability to pinpoint cell phone users and as everybody upgrades their cell phones and the older technology phones go by the wayside then we\\'ll certainly be able to do a better job pinpointing where they are calling from,\" said Davis.',\n",

       " 'The chase to corral two runaway capybaras in a Toronto park had, by last week, seen strategy after strategy falter and fall by the wayside.\\n\\nFirst, searchers tried to blitz the animals, sending more than 30 High Park staffers out in hot pursuit. Then they tried to lure them back to their zoo pen with corn. Then they tried to catch them with a net, and almost snared one of them in a coyote trap, which proved too small.\\n\\nAnd then they finally found something that worked: Blocking cars and people from an area where one of the capybaras was known to lurk, deploying a larger cage out in the open, and watching patiently as they waltzed inside, as one did Sunday evening.\\n\\nNow — with that rodent back at the zoo, recovering from its ordeal — the searchers have to do it again.\\n\\n\"(The second) one\\'s going to be posing its own challenges,\" said Ben Lovatt, a local museum owner who has participated extensively in the chase, along with park staff and rescuers from the Toronto Wildlife Centre.\\n\\n\"We\\'re giving it some time. This one\\'s going to require a lot more study and observation before people actually go in.\"\\n\\nThe first capybara was retrieved Sunday evening in the park\\'s southeast corner, near the drainage area of a pond, where passersby had spotted them in the days before the rescue. It came nearly three weeks after the animals — new arrivals to the High Park Zoo from a breeding program in Texas — absconded from their pen and disappeared into the park\\'s array of trees, trails and creeks.\\n\\nThe search party, since then, has relied heavily on reported sightings, and on the help of Lovatt and a few other private citizens, who have spent dozens of hours in recent weeks tracking the animals\\' movements and behaviour.\\n\\nThat reconnaissance led to the first capture, said Megan Price, a spokeswoman for Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation. In a game of wits, they don\\'t plan to stray from what has worked.\\n\\n\"The second plan is the same as the first plan: To narrow down, through sightings, the area that it might be located, and then to spend a couple of days looking at its patterns and its habits and where it is, so that we can really situate the traps in the best possible locations,\" Price said.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve had a couple of credible sightings. We\\'re following those up,\" she added, declining to specify exactly where the second rodent has been seen.\\n\\nRescuers aren\\'t sure which capybara they captured Sunday, and which one remains loose. One is male and the other female, but both are around six months old. Due to their youth, Price said, the veterinarian who examined the captured animal \"wasn\\'t able to ascertain the gender.\"\\n\\nRegardless, the rodent was deemed healthy, save for a few minor scratches.\\n\\nThe fundamentals, meanwhile, are in place to make the second apprehension. Once sightings of the second animal become fixed in one area of the park, staff will block off nearby roads and paths, as they did on the weekend.\\n\\n\"It was great that they were able to cordon off the area and keep people back and keep people away,\" said Nathalie Karvonen, the executive director of the Toronto Wildlife Centre, whose cage made the ensnarement.\\n\\n\"If there had been 30 people standing there, staring at the trap, (the capybara) would never have gone in.\"\\n\\nFor now, the cat-and-mouse saga continues. Price said more than 20 staffers are stationed across High Park every day, performing their regular duties and watching, hopefully, for any flicker of fur in the distance. The public is also encouraged to stay vigilant.\\n\\n\"When you\\'re working with an animal, it\\'s a dynamic environment,\" Lovatt said. \"You kind of have to see how things go as they go.\"\\n\\nPrice agreed, noting that the city has no projected or hopeful timeline for the second capture.\\n\\n\"You should probably ask the capybara that,\" she said.',\n",
       " 'Getty Images\\n\\nThe teams picking at the top of drafts are always hoping for immediate impact.\\n\\nBut for teams deeper in the order, patience is a necessity, especially with a growing sense that players entering the NFL aren\\'t as ready as they used to be. Whether it\\'s because of increased early entrants or the systems college teams are running, more and more teams end up drafting players who can\\'t be immediately useful.\\n\\nPanthers General Manager Dave Gettleman invoked former 49ers coach Bill Walsh saying he had a \"two-year rule\" to see if a player had a future with the team, but said it now has to be a three-year process.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not getting instant oatmeal anymore,\" Gettleman said. \"And you\\'ve got to understand there\\'s going to be growing pains. Nothing\\'s easy. A guy can have all the talent in the world. But this game is about fundamentals and when we\\'re getting them they don\\'t have it. So our coaches have to really coach and teach, and it takes longer.\"\\n\\nGettleman illustrated his willingness to take the long view last year, drafting linebacker Shaq Thompson with the 25th pick, choosing a guy who might eventually replace Thomas Davis. Thompson started 10 games but played a fairly limited role for the Panthers this year (only 34.3 percent of their defensive snaps), as they try to get the college utility player ready to contribute more.\\n\\nAnd the guy Gettleman might have preferred to Thompson also illustrates that principle. The Panthers would have taken Florida offensive tackle D.J. Humphries, but the Cardinals chose him a pick before. Humphries wasn\\'t ready to win a starting job out of training camp, and was inactive for all 16 games this season.\\n\\n\"We drafted D.J. last year knowing we were going to redshirt him because we had so much to teach him,\" Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said. \"If he threw him out there, he was going to fail. Once they fail, it\\'s hard to get those scars off. He didn\\'t dress a game purposefully just to get better and better.\"\\n\\nFor teams like the Panthers and Cardinals which have had success recently, it\\'s easier to give a guy time to learn, since the staffs have a sense of security that allows development. Bad teams with coaches under pressure don\\'t have the luxury. It also takes a roster talented enough that rookies aren\\'t forced into situations they\\'re not ready for.',\n",

It is hot in the Middle East . In the summer, temperatures can routinely reach 130 degrees. Even if the stadiums use advanced cooling technology — promised by the Qataris in their bid, but still untested — it is not a stretch to think there will be issues. No one disputes this.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nBut that does not mean there are not other considerations. Gulati divides the concerns into four categories: how a change affects participants, including players, officials and fans; how it affects FIFA\\'s economics (as it relates, for example, to television agreements); how it affects FIFA constituents, like the various domestic leagues and club teams around the world; and how it affects the Qatari organizing committee, which ostensibly bid on a summer World Cup.\\n\\nAll of these factors are significant. Some observers have speculated that a change in dates could lead various entities — including the countries that lost out on the bid to host the 2022 World Cup — to seek legal action. Corporate partners with FIFA might take similar paths, opening the organization to serious liability. Would the Qatari organizers indemnify FIFA against potential legal problems? \"We don\\'t know anything about that,\" Gulati said. \"But obviously that is important to know.\"\\n\\nMany of the European leagues have come out against a move to winter because of the havoc it would cause with league schedules.

In just one example, Fox and Telemundo bid about $1 billion to broadcast the World Cup in the United States in 2018 and 2022.

That\\'s a reality we have to consider. And it\\'s just one of a hundred things like that which need to be considered.\"\\n\\nBlatter and Platini, among others, seem to feel otherwise.

A change in nations is unlikely, and while there are human rights concerns with Qatar — just as there are with the 2014 Olympics and the 2018 World Cup in Russia — that is not the main problem of the moment.\\n\\nGulati, who was part of the failed bid from the United States to host in 2022, acknowledged that losing to Qatar stung. \"It was a significant setback, personally and professionally and for our federation,\" he said.

       " 'Spare us any more hooey about \"preventing fraud\" and \"protecting the integrity of the ballot box.\" The Republican-led crusade for voter ID laws has been revealed as a cynical ploy to disenfranchise as many likely Democratic voters as possible, with poor people and minorities the main targets.\\n\\nRecent developments in Pennsylvania — one of more than a dozen states where voting rights are under siege — should be enough to erase any lingering doubt: The GOP is trying to pull off an unconscionable crime.\\n\\nLate last month, the majority leader of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Mike Turzai, was addressing a meeting of the Republican State Committee. He must have felt at ease among friends because he spoke a bit too frankly.\\n\\nTicking off a list of recent accomplishments by the GOP-controlled Legislature, he mentioned the new law forcing voters to show a photo ID at the polls. Said Turzai, with more than a hint of triumph: \"Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania — done.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s not even slightly ambiguous. The Democratic presidential candidate has won Pennsylvania in every election since 1992. But now the top Republican in the Pennsylvania House is boasting that, because of the new voter ID law, Mitt Romney will defy history and capture the state\\'s 20 electoral votes in November.\\n\\nWhy on earth would Turzai imagine such a result? After all, the law applies to all voters, regardless of party affiliation. It is ostensibly meant only to safeguard the electoral process and eliminate fraud. Why would a neutral law have such partisan impact?\\n\\nThanks to figures released last week by state officials, we know the answer. It turns out that 758,939 registered Pennsylvania voters do not have the most easily obtained and widely used photo ID, a state driver\\'s license. That\\'s an incredible 9.2 percent of the registered electorate.\\n\\nMost of the voters without driver\\'s licenses live in urban areas — which just happen to be places where poor people and minorities tend to live. More than 185,000 of these voters without licenses, about one-fourth of the total, live in Philadelphia — which just happens to be a Democratic stronghold where African Americans are a plurality.\\n\\nCould suppressing the urban minority vote really give Pennsylvania to Romney? It probably wouldn\\'t have made a difference in 2008, when Obama trounced John McCain handily. But the statewide contest is often much closer — and turnout in Philadelphia typically is key to a Democratic candidate\\'s prospects. In 2004, for example, John Kerry\\'s margin over George W. Bush in the state was a mere 144,248.\\n\\nPerhaps these numbers are so intoxicating that Turzai forgot the cover story about how voter ID is supposed to protect the franchise rather than selectively restrict it. His spokesman later explained that Turzai meant \"the Republican presidential candidate will be on a more even keel thanks to voter ID\" — in other words, there will be a level playing field once the new law eliminates all that pesky voter fraud.\\n\\nThat might be reasonable, except for one fact: There\\'s no fraud to eliminate.\\n\\nProdded by GOP political activists, the Justice Department under Bush conducted an extensive, nationwide, five-year probe of voter fraud — and ended up convicting a grand total of 86 individuals, according to a 2007 New York Times report. Most of the cases involved felons or immigrants who may not have known they were ineligible to vote.\\n\\nNot one case involved the only kind of fraud that voter ID could theoretically prevent: impersonation of a registered voter by someone else. Pennsylvania and other voter ID states have, in essence, passed laws that will be highly effective in eradicating unicorns.\\n\\nThe Pennsylvania law and others like it are under attack in the courts; this week, a federal three-judge panel in Washington is hearing arguments on Texas\\'s year-old law, with a ruling expected next month. Meanwhile, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a conservative Republican, broke with orthodoxy last week and vetoed bills that would have toughened an existing voter ID statute. Maybe the tide is turning. If it doesn\\'t, these laws will potentially disenfranchise or discourage millions of qualified voters.\\n\\nIn a previous column, I wrote that voter ID was a solution in search of a problem. I was wrong: The problem seems to be that too many of the wrong kind of voters — low-income, urban, African American, Hispanic — are showing up at the polls.

Exercise time was adjusted to maintain caloric expenditure (400 kcal per session). Single-slice computed tomography scans obtained at the L4-L5 disc space and midthigh were used to determine abdominal fat and thigh muscle cross-sectional areas. Percent body fat was assessed by air displacement plethysmography.\\n\\nRESULTS:\\n\\nHIET significantly reduced total abdominal fat (P < 0.001), abdominal subcutaneous fat (P = 0.034), and AVF (P = 0.010).

Paul Ryan, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. In a statement issued Friday night, the Romney campaign said the running mate would be revealed at 9 a.m. EDT at the Nauticus Museum. Romney is kicking off a four-day bus tour through swing states.\\n\\nA source tells CBS News that Romney called Portman to say he wouldn\\'t be vice president. Portman will be participating in a bike ride in Ohio Saturday, as planned, to raise money for cancer research.\\n\\nSpeculation has focused in recent days on Ryan, the seven-term congressman. Conservative pundits have been urging Romney to choose Ryan in large part because of his authorship of a House-backed budget plan that seeks to curb overall entitlement spending and changes Medicaid into a voucher-like system to save costs.\\n\\nPawlenty was maintaining his Saturday schedule campaigning for Romney in New Hampshire, an official close to Pawlenty\\'s political team said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak ahead of the formal announcement.\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal, in an editorial on Thursday, praised Ryan as a strong choice for Romney: \"The case for Mr. Ryan is that he best exemplifies the nature and stakes of this election. More than any other politician, the House budget chairman has defined those stakes well as a generational choice about the role of government and whether America will once again become a growth economy or sink into interest-group dominated decline.\"\\n\\nRomney\\'s choice comes as he tries to repair an image damaged by negative Democratic advertising and shift the trajectory of a campaign that\\'s seen him lose ground to President Barack Obama.\\n\\nThe vice presidential selection will dominate headlines, and Romney\\'s team has been relentlessly teasing the announcement for weeks.\\n\\nRomney\\'s bus tour was expected to include appearances with Portman, as well as two others talked about as possible contenders for running mate: Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\\n\\nThe tour starts Saturday and will take Romney through four must-win states in as many days: North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and Ohio.

       " 'Currently the labeling of rivers is a bit of kludge (i.e., a complete kludge) that happens separately before all the other labeling.\\xa0 The algorithm looks along the river for a spot long enough to accommodate the label and not too curvy.\\xa0 If there\\'s a city or another river joining this river, the algorithm skips over that obstruction and starts looking again.\\xa0 If it eventually finds a suitable spot, it makes a copy of the river (path) where it wants to place the label, relaxes the copied path (so it\\'s less curvy than the river) and then writes the label along that path with an offset so that it isn\\'t directly on top of the river.\\xa0 Somewhere in there it also has to figure out whether to flip the label so that it doesn\\'t end up reading left-to-right.\\xa0 (In the above map, you can see that \"R. Geheyusckuta\" has been flipped.) Generally speaking, this works fairly well but has some drawbacks.\\xa0 The algorithm is conservative, so when it places a river label it usually looks okay, but it means a lot of rivers go unlabeled.\\xa0 And since river labels are placed before all other labels and treated as obstacles, they sometimes prevent good placement of other labels.\\xa0 Finally, the algorithm is specific to rivers, and doesn\\'t work for labeling other paths.\\xa0 For these reasons, I\\'d like to build general path labels into the simulated annealing algorithm, and let them get positioned in concert with all the other labels.\\xa0 Much of what I have written for the existing river labels algorithm will still be applicable.\\xa0 The simulated annealing will find a location for the label, but the rest of displaying the label on the map will be very similar to the current algorithm.\\xa0 (I hope!) To add path labels to the simulated annealing algorithm I need two elements: (1) a way to find new candidate locations, and (2) the criteria for judging how good a location would be for the label. A candidate location for a path label starts by selecting a location on the path.\\xa0 Just to get the code going, I started by selecting the start of the river and anchoring the labels there.\\n(I\\'ve turned off the forests to make the labels more visible.)\\xa0 That seems to be working, so now I\\'ll extend that to anchor the label at a random point along the length of the river, like this:\\nThis is actually a little harder to do than you might imagine, because I have the path as a series of line segments. \\xa0So picking a random point along there involves something like picking a random line segment -- weighted by the length of the segment -- and then picking a random point within the segment. \\xa0Fortunately, there turns out to be an easier approach. Since I\\'ve drawn the path, I can make use of some of the browser-provided methods for dealing with SVG paths. \\xa0It turns out that the browser provides a method for measuring down the length of a path and finding the screen point at that location.\\xa0 So I can generate a candidate point by generating a random number between 0 and the length of the path and then using the SVG method to find the point at that distance.\\xa0 This point represents the start of the label.\\xa0 Here\\'s what it looks like to generate random start points this way and anchor the labels there:\\nSo now I have a method that can generate a new candidate position for the start of the label somewhere along the river. \\xa0However, recall that in simulated annealing there\\'s a \"temperature\" that drops as the algorithm progresses. \\xa0As the temperature drops, new candidate positions should jump around less -- that is, they should progressively be restricted to being closer and closer to the current position. \\xa0I accommodate this by picking points in a window around the current position, rather than randomly along the whole length of the river.\\xa0 As the temperature drops, I make the window smaller and smaller. In the picture above, the labels are horizontal like the city and area labels. \\xa0But for path labels, I don\\'t want them to be horizontal, but to follow the path.\\xa0 To get started implementing that, I need the point on the path where the label would end if it was lying along the path.\\xa0 In other words, if the label has a length \\'l\\', I now want to look along the path until I find a point that is at least \\'l\\' distance away from the start point:\\nThe closest this point can be (if the path in-between is a straight line) is an additional distance \"l\" down the path.\\xa0 If the path is not perfectly straight, then it\\'s actually further along the path.\\xa0 In that case, I step along the path in small increments until I hit the first point that is \"l\" or further away from the start point.

       " 'Survivor: Blood vs. Water was the first season to see loved ones competing against each other, and two of those loved ones pairs were married couples Brad and Monica Culpepper and John and Candice Cody. The castaways were divided into two tribes: Galang, comprised of returning players, and Tadhana, the returning players\\' loved ones. John\\'s wife Candice was booted from Galang in an immediate vote-off and sent to Redemption Island. Despite this initial setback, John quickly got himself into the majority on Tadhana as part of Brad\\'s all guys alliance. John trusted Brad, even going so far as to share idol clues with him, but as Tadhana continued to lose, Brad became paranoid that Candice would return to the game and take John away from him. Brad\\'s paranoia led to him blindsiding John and sending him to Redemption Island; this move saw the end of the all guys alliance when at the next tribal council the tribe voted out Brad. Both John and Brad eventually lost at Redemption Island, leaving the game pre-merge.\\n\\nInside Survivor reached out to John to get his thoughts on Brad\\'s return to Survivor: Game Changers.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This interview was conducted in June 2016 while Survivor: Game Changers was still filming in Fiji.\\n\\n1) Hey John, thanks for doing this. In Blood vs. Water, it was presented on TV as if Brad was in control of those first few votes. Was that true? If so, how did he gain such control?\\n\\nBrad was definitely in control for the first vote, since he quickly went around and got all the guys together. Everyone was on board with not being the first to go home, so we let it ride. He definitely was less in control the second vote. At that point, Vytas Baskauskas really took over until the swap in my opinion.\\n\\n2) He came across to viewers as a bold, in-your-face type character. What was he like to live with day-to-day? Big personality all the time? Or did he have a chill side too?\\n\\nBrad is a very entertaining guy. He\\'s very much a \"talk first, think later\" kind of guy which is great for entertainment purposes. He had a ton of stories and jokes and was generally well liked. That\\'s not to say that his personality isn\\'t off-putting to some people. He would definitely fill the air if it were vacant, which means a lot coming from a loud, talkative guy like me, and I think that bothered some people. So I guess he\\'s a big personality all the time. Even his \"chill\" side is intense and high energy.\\n\\n3) Brad seemed to be all about the \"bro down\" in Blood vs. Water. What was his relationship like with the women on the tribe?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what most of the women (except Marissa Peterson) thought on the whole about Brad, but he didn\\'t make much of an effort at all to include them in strategy. I do know that a few people felt like he talked \"at\" them a lot and not \"with\" them.\\n\\n4) Brad blindsided you because he didn\\'t trust that you\\'d stay loyal to him at the merge. Was Brad right to make that move? What was your plan moving forward?\\n\\nNo, it was an idiotic move! We\\'ve talked about it since, and he agrees, but always defends it in the context of worrying about his wife, Monica. Ultimately it led to his downfall. Before I was voted out by Brad and Vytas, we hadn\\'t talked about breaking up the five guys alliance at all. His concern was that if Candice came back in (which she very likely would have), that she would not want to work with Brad and Monica. That is probably true, but that was many many moves ahead. He had no idea if Monica would even make it that far. He made a move that fractured our alliance and made people not trust each other, and basically helped keep the tribe weaker and going to tribal council over and over again.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, at a really early time point, he turned on the one person who said they would look out for him because I needed people like him around to keep the target off of me. It didn\\'t work out for either of us. I would have kept working with Brad and even Monica if it suited my gameplay, but if I had the opportunity to vote Monica out, I absolutely would have done it after she voted for Candice. The family dynamic was pretty suffocating in our season from a gameplay perspective.\\n\\n5) What is Brad\\'s most positive attribute and his most negative attribute?\\n\\nBrad is a likable guy, very good at challenges, and really helpful around camp. Honestly, if he can lay low, he probably can do really well and make it far. He\\'s',\n",
       " 'So you bought hair products with the word \"curl\" on the bottles and watched a few tutorials by a YouTuber who has your dream curls, but for some reason your hair still isn\\'t coming out the way you want it to. Let\\'s take a step back: Do you have the same curl pattern as the person whose curls you\\'re envying? If not, you may be setting your curls up to fail.\\n\\nIf you are new to the world of natural curls, getting to know your curl pattern can help you discover styling techniques and products that will work for you. You\\'ll also be able to more easily find the videos that\\'ll be most relevant to you.\\n\\nRelated: What\\'s Your Hair Type? Take The Quiz\\n\\nWhat\\'s a curl pattern?\\n\\nAt NaturallyCurly, we find it useful to divide curl patterns into three main groups: wavy, curly, and coily. We know \"curly\" means a lot of things to a lot of people, and we wince when we see comments on social media saying \"Those aren\\'t real curls; those are just waves!\" We have no tolerance for comments that insinuate that one curl pattern is better or worse than another. It goes without saying, but we\\'ll say it anyway: We want women of all curl patterns to love and embrace their hair. This texture-typing system is not meant to be divisive, but to provide guidance that will help you care for, style, and LOVE your mane.\\n\\nWhere to start\\n\\nThe best time to identify your curl pattern is when your hair is at its healthiest state; this means moisturized and free of damage. If you have been straightening your hair for the past few years or even months, you may have heat damage. To get a clear idea of your natural curl pattern, it\\'s best to look at it once you have stopped using heat tools — including blow dryers, flat irons, and curling wands — for at least three months. If the roots are curlier than the ends of your hair, then this is a clear indicator of heat damage, and figuring out your curl pattern may be a struggle until your natural curls grow in and the damaged ends have been cut off.\\n\\nIf you have curl patterns that are drastically different from each other, you may want to treat those sections of your hair differently\\n\\nRemember, most people are a mix of a couple of curl patterns. As you can see in the graphic above, we included examples of someone who could be considered Type 2c/3a, and someone who fits in between Types 3c and 4a. If you feel you fit multiple curl patterns, that is totally normal. If you have curl patterns that are drastically different from each other, you may want to treat those sections of your hair differently (for example, using heavier products in one section) or some use perm rods to create a uniform curl pattern. Finding an experienced stylist who knows how to work with curls can also help customize your haircut to accommodate your multiple curl patterns (so one section doesn\\'t look longer than another).\\n\\nBelow, find descriptions for the three most common types of curly hair. Within each of the categories, there are more subtle distinctions; read on to determine which one fits you best.\\n\\nWavy Hair\\n\\nWavy hair is characterized by S-shaped waves (rather than coils). Women with wavy hair typically use mousses, leave-in serums, and heat protectants rather than creams or gels, and are generally most concerned with reducing their frizz and finding products that will give their waves light hold without weighing them down. Those with wavy hair are less likely to avoid certain ingredients like silicones and sulfates, and more likely to use heat-styling tools like flat irons or curling wands. Think Taylor Swift (back before she straightened her hair) and Lorde.\\n\\nIf your hair is close to straight but has a loose, gentle bend, you likely have Type 2a waves. If your hair is mostly straight at the roots and more defined waves form below your eye level, your waves are Type 2b. If your waves start right at the roots and you have very defined waves mixed with actual ringlets, then you are Type 2c.\\n\\nCurly Hair\\n\\nType 3 hair has more defined, springy curls that form spirals or ringlets. Those with Type 3 hair are mostly concerned with reducing frizz and adding definition. They use creams and gels to give their curls definition, and they\\'re more likely to avoid drying ingredients in their shampoos.\\n\\nIf your curls are similar in size to the large sidewalk chalk you used as a kid, then you\\'re Type 3a. If your curls have the circumference of a Sharpie, then you\\'re Type 3b. And if your curls have the circumference of a pencil or a straw, then you\\'re Type 3c. Many people believe (',\n",

It transpires that Control believed one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian agent - a mole - and the Hungary operation was an attempt to identify which of them it was. Smiley had been forced into retirement by the departure of Control, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by a rogue agent, Ricky Tarr, that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him.

       " 'An activist federal judge who declared \"Black Lives Matter\" in court last year evidently believes Muslims have an unlimited right to enter the United States.\\n\\n\\nKeep in mind this loon was appointed by George W. Bush.\\n\\n\\nFrom The Seattle Times:\\n\\nA federal judge in Seattle has ordered a halt to enforcement of President Trump\\'s controversial travel ban on citizens from seven predominantly Muslim nations.\\n\\n\\nU.S. District Judge James Robart ruled in favor Friday of Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who sued to invalidate key provisions of Trump\\'s executive order. That order indefinitely blocks entry to the United States for Syrian refugees and temporarily suspends entry to citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries.\\n\\n\\nThe temporary restraining order is granted on a nationwide basis, Robart said.\\n\\n\\n...In his oral ruling, Robart said Washington had standing to bring the case forward and provided evidence that Trump\\'s order has immediate harm. And the lawsuit, the judge said, has substantial likelihood of success in its underlying challenge to the constitutionality of the order.\\n\\n\\n...In a legal filing asking for the restraining order, Ferguson argued Trump\\'s travel ban targets Muslims, violating the constitutional rights of immigrants and their families.\\n\\n\\n\"Federal courts have no more sacred role than protecting marginalized groups against irrational, discriminatory conduct,\" reads the filing by Ferguson, state Solicitor General Noah Purcell and Colleen Melody, head of the attorney general\\'s civil-rights unit. FDR literally threw Japanese people in internment camps and that was ruled legal. There\\'s a reason no other judge entertained this garbage. But in a response brief filed late Thursday, attorneys for the Trump administration said Washington state lacked standing to bring the challenge, and that the president has properly exercised his broad, border-security powers to protect Americans.\\n\\n\\n\"Every President over the last thirty years has invoked this authority to suspend or impose restrictions on the entry of certain aliens or classes of aliens, in some instances including classifications based on nationality,\" reads the administration brief, submitted by Chad Readler, acting assistant U.S. attorney general, and other Justice Department lawyers.\\n\\n\\nThe administration brief also cited previous court rulings that say there is no constitutional right of entry to the U.S. for foreign nationals. I\\'m surprised Robart didn\\'t throw out a black power fist and scream \"Muslim lives matter.\"\\n\\n\\nThis incident from a few months ago should give you an idea of the type of intellect we\\'re dealing with here.\\n\\n\\nFrom The Daily Caller:\\n\\nA federal judge in Washington state declared \"black lives matter\" during a hearing Monday.\\n\\n\\nU.S. District Judge James Robart, a former President George W. Bush appointee, is presiding over the implementation of a 2012 consent decree requiring Seattle to adopt various police reforms. The city\\'s police department was accused by the federal government of engaging in various practices, such as excessive force, that fell disproportionately on non-white residents and therefore violated their civil rights. The consent decree was reached so the city could avoid fighting a costly lawsuit against the feds.\\n\\n\\nThis is the first time the contentious political movement has had its anthem officially supported by a judge in a federal courtroom.\\n\\n\\nImplementing that consent decree is requiring extensive negotiations with Seattle\\'s police union, because some of the reforms it prescribes would modify their current contract. For instance, putting internal investigations in the hands of civilians, rather than police officers. Most recently, the union voted to reject a contract that would have implemented certain reforms while giving officers a small pay boost.\\n\\n\\nIn a Monday hearing, Robart lashed out at the union for holding up the reform process.\\n\\n\\n\"The court and the citizens of Seattle will not be held hostage for increased payments and benefits,\" he said from the bench. \"I\\'m sure the entire city of Seattle would march behind me.\"\\n\\n\\nThen, Robart stunned the courtroom by explicitly tying the proceedings to the Black Lives Matter movement. According to The Seattle Times, he cited statistics that blacks represent 41 percent of all people shot by police, when they are just 20 percent of the population. This is a mistake on Robart\\'s part; blacks are actually just 13 percent of the population.\\n\\n\\n\"Black lives matter,\" Robart said to end his remarks, in a moment that apparently produced audible shock from the courtroom. Black Lives Matter has been active for three years as a movement, but this appears to be the first time it has garnered such explicit support in court from a federal judge.

When a 95% confidence interval is constructed, all values in the interval are considered plausible values for the parameter being estimated. Values outside the interval are rejected as relatively implausible. If the value of the parameter specified by the null hypothesis is contained in the 95% interval then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 0.05 level .

And sometimes it has had serious repercussions for real people and businesses.\\n\\nThat\\'s what happened to a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., recently, when an armed man claiming to be \"self-investigating\" a fake news story entered the restaurant and fired off several rounds.\\n\\nBut once a fake news story is out there, and the harm has been done, what can a person do about it?\\n\\nDerigan Silver, a professor of media, First Amendment and Internet law at the University of Denver, tells NPR\\'s Audie Cornish that victims of fake news stories have legal recourse under defamation law.\\n\\n\"Fake news sites are clearly a situation where they\\'re engaging in a defamatory statement, a false statement about another that damages that person\\'s reputation,\" Silver says. \"In that situation, that is certainly actionable.\"\\n\\nInterview Highlights\\n\\nOn the legal recourse for victims of fake news stories\\n\\nSo in most of these situations, the person that has been harmed is going to bring a lawsuit that we call a tort. Now a tort is a noncontractual harm between two private individuals. It\\'s a civil lawsuit, where you\\'re alleging that one person harmed another. ...\\n\\nSo anytime one private individual harms another private individual, you can bring a lawsuit for a tort. So one of those torts that people can have advantage of is called defamation. Defamation is a tort that alleges that a communication damaged your reputation.\\n\\nOn who\\'s accountable for fake news stories\\n\\nThey can hold accountable anybody who has communicated the defamatory statement to anybody else. That includes the person who originated the defamatory statement, but under something called the republication rule, it also includes anybody who repeated the defamatory statement. Now simply retweeting a defamatory statement is probably not going to be enough to qualify for republication, but passing on information that you heard from somebody else certainly is republication.\\n\\nSo you have some cases coming out of Texas, for example, where hundreds and hundreds of people were adding to a posting that had more and more and more defamatory contents. And if you can track those people down, if you can find out those identities, then yes, you can sue every single person who sort of adds to that defamatory statement or repeats that defamatory statement.\\n\\nU.S. Comet Ping Pong Owner James Alefantis On Conspiracy Theory Ordeal Fake News Surge Pins D.C. Pizzeria As Home To Child-Trafficking Listen · 3:55 3:55\\n\\nOn the challenges of filing defamation lawsuits\\n\\nThat\\'s one of the problems with defamation law is once the information is out there, is monetary damages really what they want to recover? And should they have to be able to pay lawyers [$400], $500 an hour in order to recover their good name from a story that is clearly made up and clearly fictitious and clearly has no basis in reality at all?\\n\\nOn the current debate over defamation laws\\n\\nI think that fake news really has kind of all set us back a little bit. One of the ideas behind the First Amendment is that we believe in something called the marketplace of ideas: that if you let \"truthhood\" and falsity battle in the marketplace of ideas, that truth will eventually win, that we have an assumption that people are rational, and they can determine truth from falsity.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s kind of making us rethink these kind of basic premises behind freedom of expression. Are we in a situation now where truth no longer matters, and people are not able to sort these things out?\\n\\nOther people say, you know, the idea that truth is always going to win is idle sentimentality. The reason we have freedom of expression is not because truth will always win, but because without freedom of expression, truth has no chance of winning whatsoever.\\n\\nAnd so this has been a really challenging election for a lot of people who believe in free speech, and media law has actually come up a lot in this election, and it\\'s something that a lot of us are thinking deeply about.',\n",

       " \"Did South African higher education have a hand in our resurgent student voice? Absolutely, student activists would argue, but for its lack of transformation serving as an obstacle rather than an ally in the project of change. Campus debates on change relate not only to transformation but also to how prominent and capable student voices feature in struggles for institutional identity, values and curriculum. Much more than Mcebo Dlamini's Hitler comments, it is the exciting commentaries on higher education change in campaigns such as #RhodesMustFall, #TransformWits and #OpenStellies that demand higher education examine its engagement of student provocateurs.\\n\\nOn the back foot\\n\\nDespite their authentic attempts to expedite change, more often than not universities seem to be on the back foot when students disrupt established lines of thought and practice — a stance that would not be worrying if South African students could claim a well-established and accomplished position as co-creators of knowledge in the classroom and as co-authors of institutional transformation. A poo-protest to disrupt colonial history surely would read different when a university community already are engaged in difficult dialogues and openly debate difficult decisions on institutional change, as also would protesters chained to Paul Kruger's statue to protect their heritage.\\n\\nOne problem key to students' distrust of higher education transformation is that of a silent vanguard — the silent voice of the student affairs' division in the higher education debate. As a penultimate institutional environment that concerns itself with the holistic wellness and development of students, the student affairs' office offers campus communities access to and sites for talking and listening to students. There, in the residence hall, on the sport field, at the theatre or the freshers' ball, across the forum table, on social media and in counselling sessions, student affairs practitioners hear, see and discover the hearts and minds of students — the full range of social spaces that students live with are its concern, and its classroom.\\n\\nStudent affairs as vanguard\\n\\nFor this reason, as students offer a vanguard to society, student affairs could do so for higher education. At its best, student affairs as a vanguard contributes most to institutional debates when it facilitates a vibrant student voice in the authorship of an institutional narrative – the lived experience and sense of identity of a campus community, and its story then told. Student affairs must do what a vanguard should – move with next generation to discover new perspectives and translate its discoveries for a campus community that follows. Get it right and the university community knows what debates the next generation will point at, but get it wrong, and the vanguard is silent, or worse still, silenced, and the student voice left to a nervous condition.\\n\\nStudents become authors when they achieve that level of wellness and capability to critically reflect on their life narrative, identity and aspirations in relation to that of others and their society, and ethically act to change their environment and serve the common good. This project succeeds outside the classroom when student development and support combine well in daily student life – opportunities to develop activist skills and social support for quality of life are sides of the same coin in student affairs practice.\\n\\nTeaching under trees\\n\\nBut what many campuses misjudge is the complexity of this interface of learning and support – the landscape of curriculum logic and pedagogy as a major part of professional support and student development programmes. It is for instance a complex matter to mentor leaders, while also administrating the logistics of housing, but this is precisely what student affairs as a higher education vanguard must do. This is teaching in the mode of serving students holistically. This is teaching under trees, a way of life.\\n\\nWhile campuses value the vanguard voice of student affairs differently, often in worst cases limiting its contribution to operational planning and practice as support service environment, student affairs often are silent more than silenced. Silent, when student affairs environments do not appropriately engage the educational project required to facilitate authorship among students, or do not appropriately translate the student voice institutionally.\\n\\nStrong vanguard voice\\n\\nIts educational project for student authorship should consist of the curriculum design, pedagogical practice and assessment of student development programmes, such as for student leadership development, but also for student life and wellness programmes co-created by students and student affairs practitioners. Its translation project for student authorship should consist of institutional advocacy for depth and reach of student participation, establishment of safe spaces for challenging dialogue and facilitating a vibrant student initiative.\\n\\nIn vigorous pedagogy and unrelenting advocacy lies a strong vanguard voice.\\n\\nWhat recent student activism unmasks is the silence of our vanguard – silent not for its lack of an educational project, but for the hidden and hesitant position of its curriculum and pedagogy. What student affairs in South Africa now needs, is to make plain its vanguard pedagogy, its teaching under trees.\",\n",
       " 'REVERSE MESSAGES IN JOHN TRAVOLTA\\'S MOVIE – PHENOMENON\\n\\nBy David John Oates\\n\\nCopyright © 1996\\n\\nNew Reversals on movie soundtrack posted below (4/16/00)\\n\\nAuthors note: Recently I have been contacted by several people wanting to use this article and other reversals I have found on \"Phenomenon\" to bolster an argument that Scientology are using subliminal programming in this and other publications. I do not believe this to be the case! What you are seeing is the Reverse Speech phenomenon in action and it occurs in all forms of human speech. The deliberate \"backmasked\" section on Peter Gabriel\\'s song is a common recording trick used by many artists for special effects. There is nothing sinister in this at all. To those people wanting to use this as an arguement, I say the same thing to you as I said to the fundamentalist christians when they went ballistic over reversed messages in rock and roll songs. Look at your own speech and publications before you jump to rapid judgement at others. You will find the same messages in your speech as you claim others are deliberately putting into theirs. Reverse Speech is everywhere – in the goodies as well as the baddies. It is a natural function of language, no more and no less. (DJO 4/2000)\\n\\nIn the middle of 1996, John Travolta\\'s new movie Phenomenon was released. The movie was about a simple farmer who was hit by a strange beam of light from the sky. This gave him amazing new intelligence and unexplained powers.\\n\\nSince the movie\\'s release, controversy has begun to arise concerning its real message and purpose. According to the Globe tabloid, which quotes two disc jockeys from Flint Michigan, Phenomenon is riddled with secret references to John Travolta\\'s belief in Scientology. Click here to see a reprint of the Globe article.\\n\\nOne of the specific claims is that the movie\\'s theme song, \"I have the touch\", sung by British rocker Peter Gabriel, contains hidden backward messages. The most obvious, according to Mitch Gill and Tommy Walker (the Michigan DJs) is the very clear phrase, \"Don\\'t you miss Ron?\" This is supposedly a reference to Scientology\\'s founder, the late Ron Hubbard. I spoke with Mitch and Tommy by phone and was curious enough to do some of my own research.\\n\\nAs charges of intentional backmasking were denied by Peter Gabriel\\'s publicist, I initially assumed that the song contained the standard speech reversals that I have discovered occur in all music and speech. As these reversals are a natural function of the human mind, they appear in all songs and are, naturally, unplanned by the recording studio or artist. It seemed fairly logical to me that speech reversals would occur that supported Travolta\\'s belief in Scientology. There seemed to be nothing too sinister in that.\\n\\nHowever, I was in for a shock when I finally obtained a copy for the album after being approached by the nationally syndicated TV program, \"Extra\", for my opinion on the controversy. The very first thing I noticed as I played the song forwards was an intentionally backmasked message right at the beginning of the album. Intentional backmasking is totally different from Reverse Speech. Reverse Speech naturally occurs in the human mind as an automatic function of language. Backmasking is a recording technique where the studio superimposes a soundtrack backwards over the forward soundtrack. It is easy to recognise. It sounds like gibberish when the track is played forwards and becomes an intelligible sentence when the track is played backwards.\\n\\nReverse Speech has no superimposed soundtrack and occurs solely by the way the words are sung or spoken at the time the recording is made.\\n\\nListen to the first example of a hidden message on this song. Notice that is sounds like gibberish forwards. When it is played backwards at three separate speeds, the words \"Don\\'t you miss Ron?\" can be heard. It sounds a little strange because it has been hidden somewhat by echo effects. This is an example of an intentionally backmasked message (Backward Masking) at the recording studio level. I am somewhat surprised, therefore, that Peter Gabriel\\'s publicist has denied putting this in because it is an obvious technical insertion. Maybe it was done in the recording studio after the song was made. Either way, there is nothing sinister in this. The message is meaningless.\\n\\nThe next thing I noticed as I listened to the soundtrack forwards is that there is also an example of a hidden subliminal message in the song. It is forwards, faint and fast, and occurs right at the very end of the soundtrack. It says: \"Ron Hubbard, Ron Ron Ron, Ron Hubbard make contact.\" It is unclear whether this was intentional or not.\\n\\nFinally I checked the soundtrack for Reverse Speech and my eyes really opened wide. I first found a very clear example',\n",

       " \"In yesterday's article we covered the beginner and intermediate versions of the pyramid routine. Today we will cover the advanced versions of weight training using pyramid routines – the Oxford Method and ascending rest-pause routine.\\n\\nFor some people, the Oxford Method is more of an intermediate pyramid routine. It is similar to reverse pyramid sets. You will use a really heavy weight for the first set and decrease as your muscles fatigue for each subsequent set. Your rep range will be dependent upon the type of training you want to do – low reps (4-6) for strength/power, average reps (8-12) for building mass and high reps (15-20) for endurance. To do the first set, choose a weight that you can JUST do 10 times and cannot do the 11th rep. For the next set, you will do the same thing except use a lower weight (usually 10% less than set 1). You should just complete 10 reps. For the third and final set, decrease the weight again and do 10 more reps. Depending on how aggressive you want to be, 2 sets may be enough or you may want to increase it to 4.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nThe most advanced form of Pyramid Routine is the ascending rest-pause. The intent is to workout with larger weights but to mix in rest periods to allow your muscles to recover partially before continuing. Choose a weight that you can do for 10 reps but only do 5. Rest for 5 seconds and then do 5 more reps. Rest another 5 seconds and do 5 more reps. That makes one set. Add 5-10 pounds of weight (your 9 rep max) and do the same process but for 4 reps and rest for 10 seconds. Continue to 3 reps with 5-10 more pounds and rest 15 seconds then to 2 reps with 5-10 more pounds. This last set is done to failure; keep doing 2 reps with rest breaks until you cannot do 2 reps.

       " 'After becoming the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in January, Sen. Patty Murray is among the leading backers of a White House plan to expand overtime pay for nearly 5 million Americans.\\n\\nWASHINGTON — With only 8 percent of salaried workers currently covered by overtime rules, Sen. Patty Murray says it\\'s time for the federal government to intervene.\\n\\nAfter becoming the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in January, the senator from Washington state is among the leading backers of a White House plan to expand overtime pay for nearly 5 million Americans.\\n\\nIt could mean raises for 90,000 workers in her home state.\\n\\nMurray faces resistance from retailers who fear that higher pay would force them to cut jobs and reduce work hours. She counters that the overtime rules are outdated, doing little to help workers who are routinely assigned to longer hours.\\n\\n\"It would mean a lot of money in people\\'s pockets, and what it basically means is you\\'re going to get paid for the work that you do,\" Murray said in an interview Tuesday.\\n\\nIn the mid-1970s, Murray said, 62 percent of the American workforce was covered by overtime rules, but that number has been in steady decline.\\n\\nUnder federal law, hourly employees are guaranteed overtime pay for working more than 40 hours per week, receiving at least 1½ times their regular rate of pay. But the rules limit overtime pay for salaried workers to those who earn less than $23,660 per year. Under the White House plan announced earlier this month by President Obama, that threshold would more than double, to $50,440.\\n\\nMurray said she\\'s confident that the new rule will take effect after the Department of Labor seeks comment on the proposal. Murray said the only way it can be blocked is if Congress intervenes. Even then, she said, Obama could use his veto power to prevail.\\n\\n\"This is something that is going to happen,\" Murray said.\\n\\nSo far, the proposal isn\\'t causing much of a fuss in Washington state. The Washington Retail Association, based in Olympia, said it had not yet decided how to react, while Amazon, the Seattle-based Internet retail giant, did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nIn Washington, D.C., it\\'s a much different story.\\n\\nIn a statement, the National Retail Federation, the nation\\'s largest retail trade association, called the plan an attempt to \"build the middle class by government mandate.\"\\n\\n\"There simply isn\\'t any magic pot of money that lets employers pay more just because the government says so,\" said David French, the group\\'s senior vice president for government relations.\\n\\nAnd House Republicans, anticipating the White House move, called a hearing on the plan in June, nearly a month before Obama announced the proposed change.\\n\\n\"Rather than providing more opportunities for individuals to earn overtime pay, it appears that the new regulations will only result in a more complicated law, requiring outside legal advice for small businesses, and more litigation,\" said Jamie Richardson, White Castle\\'s vice president of government and shareholder relations, testifying before the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.\\n\\nDespite the opposition, Murray said the plan will boost the economy by helping people spend more.\\n\\n\"If they get that additional money for working more, they\\'re going to have more in their pockets to take their kids out for pizza or to buy them another pair of shoes for school or to perhaps save for their college,\" she said.\\n\\nThe issue is just one of many pro-labor plans on Murray\\'s plate this year, after she replaced former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin as the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education and Pensions Committee. Murray called it a \"rewarding assignment.\"\\n\\nWhile she has gained much attention for overhauling the No Child Left Behind schools law, she has also used her new perch to promote a series of labor issues.\\n\\nAmong them:\\n\\n• She\\'s the chief sponsor of the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the federal minimum wage to $12 by 2020.\\n\\n• She\\'s the lead Senate Democrat on The Healthy Families Act, which would require employers to provide up to seven paid sick days per year. It would apply to companies with more 15 employees.\\n\\n• She teamed up with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, to introduce a bill aimed at giving workers more predictability in their work schedules. It would require retail, food service and cleaning employees to receive work schedules at least two weeks in advance, or one hour\\'s worth of extra pay for schedules changed with less than a 24-hour notice.\\n\\n• She has pushed to close the wage gap between men and women working the same jobs. And she released a report showing the challenges women face in retirement, with a poverty rate nearly double that of men among those 65 and older.\\n\\nFor Murray, a 64-year-old former preschool',\n",

       " 'Apple Inc. sold twice as many Watches as iPhones in each device\\'s debut year. Yet the smartwatch is dogged by a perception that seems premature given the history of Apple\\'s most popular devices: disappointment.\\n\\nAs the Watch marks its first anniversary on Sunday—two days before Apple\\'s quarterly earnings announcement—the product\\'s fate is critical to the company. It is Apple\\'s first all-new product since the iPad and a test of its ability to innovate under Chief Executive Tim Cook, when sales of iPhones are slowing.\\n\\n\\u200bSo far, the numbers appear solid. Apple doesn\\'t disclose sales, but analysts estimate about 12 million Watches were sold in year one. At an estimated average price of $500, that is a $6 billion business—three times the annual revenue of activity tracker Fitbit Inc.\\n\\nBy comparison, Apple sold roughly six million iPhones in its first year. As a new entrant, the Watch accounted for about 61% of global smartwatch sales last year, according to researcher IDC.\\n\\nAnd yet, there are detractors such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of venture-capital firm Union Square Ventures, in December declared the Watch a \"flop.\" Mr. Wilson, who owns shares of Fitbit through a fund, had earlier predicted the Watch wouldn\\'t be a \"home run\" like the iPad, iPhone and iPod, saying many people wouldn\\'t want to wear a computer on their wrist.\\n\\nThe Watch has shortcomings. It is slow, with an underpowered processor that is throttled at times to extend the device\\'s battery life. It lacks mobile and Global Positioning System connections, meaning it must be accompanied by an iPhone, limiting its usefulness as an independent device. The battery needs to be charged every day.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest challenge is the Watch\\'s lack of a defining purpose. It does certain things well, such as activity tracking, mobile payments and notifications. But there is no task the Apple Watch handles that can\\'t be done by an iPhone or a less-expensive activity tracker.\\n\\nJoshua Stein, a 33-year-old app developer in Chicago, said he bought a Watch shortly after its release, but found the software slow and thought it was inconvenient having to charge it each night. In January, he sold the Watch on eBay and returned to using a $150 Pebble smartwatch with a longer-lasting battery.\\n\\n\"Basically, I didn\\'t use it that much,\" said Mr. Stein. \"The functionality of the Watch is still pretty limited.\"\\n\\nThere are relatively easy fixes for some concerns. Apple is working on adding cell-network connectivity and a faster processor to its next-generation Watch, according to people familiar with the matter.\\n\\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \\u200b\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOther problems run deeper. Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder says the Watch isn\\'t useful enough. He expected more businesses to create apps like one from Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide Inc. that lets customers check in, receive a room assignment and unlock a room door without stopping at the front desk.\\n\\nMr. Gownder said Apple hadn\\'t done enough to build a broader ecosystem of services. \"Apple needs to make it an indispensable thing,\" he said.\\n\\nStill, the Apple Watch has fans who use it daily. According to research firm Wristly, 93% of 1,150 Apple Watch owners in an online survey last week said they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the device.\\n\\nIn a sign of how users are personalizing their watches, Apple said in March that a third of users regularly change the bands for the Watch to match their outfits or occasion. \"It\\'s become a part of my day,\" said Dana Strom, a 31-year-old video editor from Santa Monica, Calif., who received the Watch as a gift from his wife in November. \"I miss it when I don\\'t have it.\"\\n\\nHe finds notifications and turn-by-turn directions useful, though he grows frustrated at times at how slowly third-party apps run on the Watch.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Watch\\'s early struggles in some ways echo the iPhone, now considered a groundbreaking product that accounts for two-thirds of Apple\\'s revenue.\\n\\nThe initial model didn\\'t run on the then-fastest wireless network, didn\\'t offer third-party apps and lacked basic functions such as copying and pasting text.\\n\\nAs it did with the initial iPhone, Apple in March cut the price for the least-expensive version of the smaller-size Sport Watch model by $50 to $299.\\n\\nToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, estimates Apple has sold 12 million Apple Watches in the first year at an average sales price of $500. Similarly, Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a site dedicated to analysis of Apple, estimates Apple sold 13 million watches at an average price of $450.\\n\\nAdam',\n",

Bruce Goddard, Place Projects\\n\\n\"Over the GFC there was almost no construction — we had no construction for three or four years,\" he said.\\n\\n\"So there\\'s been a bit of catch up after the financial crisis, and it\\'s that catch up that is showing high volumes now,\" he said.\\n\\nHe said most major residential buildings were going up in West End, South Brisbane, Fortitude Valley and Teneriffe, with young renters increasingly looking to live close to work.\\n\\nBut he said the demand was being strongly driven by high property prices in Sydney and Melbourne.\\n\\n\"Brisbane is approximately 50 per cent cheaper than Sydney and 35 to 40 per cent cheaper than Melbourne,\" he said.\\n\\n\"International interest is growing reasonably rapidly, but I think we\\'re seeing a lot of Melbourne and Sydney buyers because Melbourne and Sydney are so dear.\\n\\n\"We track the differences in values between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, and the difference is now at a record high.\"\\n\\nMixed reports over possible oversupply in Brisbane\\n\\nDespite a record number of major residential buildings going up in the city, Mr Goddard said Brisbane was not at risk of having an oversupply of apartments any time soon.\\n\\n\"An oversupply means that there are buildings being built, for which there are no tenants,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We are nowhere near that at the moment. As the buildings are being built, there are tenants, so there is good tenant demand, and the tenant demand is driving the buyer demand.\"\\n\\nBut Dr Bryant said she believed Brisbane was nearing its saturation point.\\n\\n\"As an industry we need to keep an eye on when the market gets to the saturation point, and I would predict that we are getting very close to point,\" she said.\\n\\n\"There\\'s probably not enough demand to absorb all the supply that is proposed to come onto the market.\\n\\n\"If we meet saturation point, which is when demand sort of equals supply, then hopefully market forces would delay further apartments coming on the market.\\n\\n\"It is really important for the general economy that the property industry remain buoyant.\"\\n\\nTopics: building-and-construction, business-economics-and-finance, brisbane-4000, qld, australia',\n",

It was love at first brew. However, the brewing process left much to be desired. It was a ungainly process involving ugly plastic fermenters, a messy kitchen and thoroughly disgruntled roommates. I figured there had to be a better way to brew, one that would look at home in any environment and celebrate the process rather than hide it. In January 2013 I designed the first HopBox homebrewing kit. It was everything I wanted a brewing kit to be: stylish, portable, and accessible. I wanted to inspire people to brew, to experiment with new recipes, to feel the satisfaction that comes with sharing something you have made with family and friends. I also realized I wanted to make it more than a hobby - I wanted to make it my career. So I went all in! I quit my day job, emptied my accounts, and started living out my dream - one that I hope you share\",\n",

The exposition is clear and full of wit and humor...\" - The New Yorker (1984 American Book Award Edition)\\n\\nMathematics has been a human activity for thousands of years. Yet only a few people from the vast population of users are professional mathematicians, who create, teach, foster, and apply it in a variety of situations. The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding. This edition of the book should find a new generation of general readers and students who would like to know what mathematics is all about. It will prove invaluable as a course text for a general mathematics appreciation course, one in which the student can combine an appreciation for the esthetics with some satisfying and revealing applications.\\n\\nThe text is ideal for 1) a GE course for Liberal Arts students 2) a Capstone course for perspective teachers 3) a writing course for mathematics teachers.\\n\\nThe Companion Guide to the Mathematical Experience 120 pp. * Softcover * $14.95 * ISBN 0-8176-3849-0',\n",
       " 'Sriracha is a tasty hot sauce manufactured by Huy Fong Foods that, for those with adventurous taste buds, makes everything from scrambled eggs to pizza a finer experience. But the process of manufacturing the substance has been unpopular among residents of Irwindale, California, a small town of about 1,400 just twenty miles outside of Los Angeles. And where Irwindale smells a spicy controversy, Texas cities smell spicy opportunity.\\n\\nSriracha hasn\\'t always been based in Irwindale—the company relocated to the city in 2010, after being offered a sweetheart deal to build a $40 million factory. As the Los Angeles Times reported in November:\\n\\nHuy Fong Foods decided to locate its factory in Irwindale three years ago when the city offered a loan with \"irresistable\" terms: pay only interest for 10 years, with a balloon payment at the end. Huy Fong took the loan and contributed $250,000 a year to the city of Irwindale each year as part of the deal, Tran said. The company then built a $40-million factory that at full capacity could generate about $300 million a year in sales, according to Tran\\'s statements.\\n\\nThe problems started not long after the factory was built. It turns out that the manufacturing process on a spicy sauce (that enjoys what the Times hilariously refers to as \"rock star status among condiments\"—you\\'re always on the outside looking in, mayonnaise) isn\\'t the most pleasant thing to spend your days around. Reports soon came in about the not-unserious health problems that appeared to be popping up among local residents.\\n\\nThe city filed for a lawsuit against the facility to shut down the manufacturing after reports of \"burned eyes, inflamed asthma,\" and an entire birthday party being forced to flee indoors \"after the spicy smell descended on the festivities.\" That sounds like a joke, but in late November, a judge granted a partial injunction.\\n\\nShortly after the lawsuit against Sriracha manufacturer was filed, Denton city councilman Kevin Roden made a public bid to invite Huy Fong to relocate the facility to his fair North Texas college town.\\n\\nThe story continued to develop in recent weeks; Irwindale City Council backed down from its aggressive stance on the substance, voting to delay a decision on whether to declare the factory a public nuisance. And, over here in Texas, San Antonio threw its hat in the \"we\\'d like to host the Sriracha factory\" ring.\\n\\nMario Hernandez, president of San Antonio Economic Development Foundation, said the organization reached out two months ago to Tran, who indicated an expansion is more likely than a full-fledged relocation to the Alamo City, which would cost millions. \"We would welcome the opportunity on a complete relocation, but a more likely scenario is future expansion,\" Hernandez said. San Antonio is an ideal location for production of the spicy condiment because it is close to the Rio Grande Valley, a region with a large agriculture industry that could easily grow chilies for the product, Villalba said. Because the chilies must be transported to a factory for production soon after being harvested, San Antonio, the largest city in South Texas, logistically would be a prime location for a manufacturing plant.\\n\\nThe excitement over the opportunity to host the Sriracha factory is all very charming. It\\'s delicious! Texans love hot sauce! But also, the reason that the Sriracha factory is talking relocation is that the current host city is arguing in court that it lowered the quality of life so dramatically that it would rather lose 200 jobs and the tax benefits of hosting a factory that generates $300 million worth of revenue than continue to deal with the asthma/nosebleeds/sinus irritation/canceled birthday parties.\\n\\nAll of which suggests that, jobs and tax dollars or no jobs and tax dollars, the eagerness to take this on is a bit weird. It may be, as both Denton and San Antonio officials singing the Sriracha song claim, that those issues that caused such headaches (or nosebleeds) in Irwindale wouldn\\'t affect Denton (\"According to Roden, Denton\\'s industrial sites are located \\'far away\\' from residential neighborhoods, so Huy Fong won\\'t need to worry about future lawsuits,\" our own Joseph Misulonas explained back in November) or San Antonio (\"Hernandez and Villalba said they have no reservations about the fumes emitted from the factory because proper steps would be taken to ensure safety of nearby residents,\" reports MySA.com).\\n\\nIt\\'s nice that the cities have thought about it, but it\\'s strange to assume that officials in Irwindale didn\\'t consider any of that when they made their bid to host the factory in recent years. It\\'s possible, of course, that San Antonio and Denton would experience nothing more than an expanded tax base and a boost in jobs if they were to take on the task of hosting the Sr',\n",

The Tesla CEO is the world\\'s most prominent proponent of using innovation to do something about global warming, while the president-elect has said climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.\\n\\nBut with the opening on Wednesday of Tesla\\'s battery manufacturing factory in Nevada, Musk has suddenly wound up with a \"surprising alignment of interests with the new presidential administration,\" says Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley\\'s lead auto analyst.\\n\\nJonas, one of the most strident Tesla bulls on Wall Street, made the comment in a research note in which he assessed the Gigafactory\\'s opening and reiterated his view that the company\\'s Model 3 mass-market vehicle won\\'t launch on schedule at the end of 2017.\\n\\nBut the alignment \"really seemed to sneak up on people,\" he added.\\n\\nOf course it did — until you think about where the two line up. Tesla\\'s a high-tech domestic hiring machine.\\n\\nHere\\'s Jonas, writing about the Nevada plant:\\n\\n\"As the bus drove up to the massive plant yesterday morning, one could not help but notice the hundreds of cars in the parking lot from the construction crew (yes, roughly 1/2 of the vehicles were pickup trucks), part of 2,100 construction workers running two shifts per day.\\n\\n\"To the extent that the creation of high-tech manufacturing jobs in the United States is a priority of the incoming administration, we believe Mr. Musk might have some interests that could be very much in alignment with those of President-elect Trump.\"\\n\\nOld versus new manufacturing\\n\\nIt\\'s worth pointing out that the Obama administration was also supportive of high-tech manufacturing and that it\\'s unclear whether all US manufacturing jobs are equal in the eyes of Trump and the GOP. And don\\'t forget that constructing Tesla\\'s Nevada Gigafactory involved old-school labor, while the manufacturing of battery cells inside could eventually be almost completely automated.\\n\\nBut Jonas is onto something by highlighting what could be an unexpected and potentially awkward shared interest of Trump and Musk. The Tesla CEO did, after all, make the pilgrimage to Trump Tower along with the rest of the Silicon Valley tech elite.\\n\\nHowever, all of Musk\\'s companies require a type of government support that\\'s futuristic rather than retro. Electric cars are a threat to the oil business. Solar power — Tesla just acquired SolarCity — has benefitted from government subsidies to gain a foothold against traditional grid electricity provided by burning coal and natural gas. SpaceX has NASA as its biggest customer.\\n\\nMusk is a shining example of a businessperson who\\'s making America great now. It remains to be seen if Trump can digest that reality and come to terms with how that reality has been achieved.',\n",
       " 'Martin Harris Pageant Cast Members Are Performers, Missionaries\\n\\nContributed By Rachel Sterzer, Church News staff writer\\n\\nArticle Highlights Clarkston has been the home of the Martin Harris pageant since 1983.\\n\\nIt depicts the life of Martin Harris, who became one of the Three Witnesses to testify of the divine origin of the Book of Mormon.\\n\\nClose to 36,000 visitors traveled to Clarkston to watch the pageant.\\n\\n\"Every time I step out on stage I get chills. I feel the Spirit every time. I know Martin saw what he saw because I feel it every time.\" —Brad Noble, actor playing Martin Harris\\n\\nCLARKSTON, UTAH\\n\\nClarkston—population of about 670 at the last census—is nestled in the northwest part of Utah\\'s Cache Valley. Its patchwork of gold and green fields are fringed by views of the mountains on each side. Directions to Clarkston often include the warning that the nearest gas station is 15 to 20 miles away. There is no grocery store. Yet from July 31 to August 15, this remote farming town received close to 36,000 visitors.\\n\\nThat\\'s because since 1983, Clarkston has been the home of Martin Harris: The Man Who Knew, a pageant that depicts the life of Martin Harris, who became one of the Three Witnesses to testify of the divine origin of the Book of Mormon. The events leading up to the first publication of the Book of Mormon and Martin\\'s role in those events are presented in an outdoor amphitheater adjacent to where Martin is buried in the Clarkston cemetery.\\n\\nIncluded in those events is the incident involving the 116 manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon where, in June of 1828, after Martin\\'s repeated entreaties, Joseph Smith allowed him to take the pages to show his family. Unfortunately, through Martin\\'s negligence, the pages were lost. Both Martin and Joseph were reprimanded.\\n\\nBrad Noble, who played the role of Martin Harris in the last two productions, said one of the big themes of the pageant is that of forgiveness and repentance. \"There\\'s a line that I love at the end of the play where Joseph explains to Martin that we all need forgiveness and it\\'s Christ\\'s Atonement that does that for each and every one of us,\" said Brother Noble.\\n\\nNot only is Martin forgiven, but he also becomes one of three men allowed to see the angel Moroni display the gold plates. After the witnesses saw and handled the plates, a voice from heaven declared that the record was true and had been translated correctly.\\n\\nEach performance begins with the testimony of the Three Witnesses that is now included in the foreword of the Book of Mormon. Brother Noble said, \"Every time [I speak those words]—from the first time we did it in rehearsal and every time I step out on stage—I get chills. I feel the Spirit every time. I know Martin saw what he saw because I feel it every time.\"\\n\\nThe hour-and-fifteen-minute production is staged every odd year with a cast of about 80, with 150 volunteers. Cast members put in long hours of rehearsals and performances. However, many cast members are quick to note the blessings.\\n\\n\"This pageant is a smorgasbord, and, if you allow yourself, it is an absolute feast,\" said Jeff Richins, who played Joseph Smith Sr. in this year\\'s production but has also played the part of Martin Harris and other roles. \"You can\\'t have an experience like this every night and not want to put yourself back in that environment.\"\\n\\nPrior to each performance, cast members spent time talking with visitors, often answering questions about their character or about Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Brother Richins took the opportunity during every show to give away a copy of the Book of Mormon, in which he had written his testimony. Many other cast members reported similar experiences throughout the three-week performance schedule.\\n\\n\"We\\'re here to perform, but we\\'re also here to be missionaries,\" explained Maggie Porter, who was part of this year\\'s ensemble cast. \"This is my own little mission.\"\\n\\nTerra Smith, who played Lucy Mack Smith, the mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith, has participated in various ways in the pageant for more than a decade. The pageant has provided an opportunity for her to strengthen not only her own testimony but also the testimonies of her children, now ages 14, 13, and 12.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been a wonderful opportunity for [my children] to not only learn the story of Martin Harris and the story of how the Book of Mormon was first published and how it really came to be, but it also gives them an opportunity to really understand what missionary work is and to have that personal testimony built for themselves as well.\"\\n\\nTravis and Angela Parry and their five children, ranging from age 11 to 2, all participated in the pageant together and made it a goal for each',\n",

They seem to be trapped inside a formless screen, their surrounding the mysterious pitch-black universe, the mystical nebula with twinkling stars. Beneath them, was the titanous yellow-earth backdrop of the planet. Because they had entered this world as a temporary party, thus, the ending of this story was similar.\\n\\nFollowing that, was naturally the battlefield overview reflection. Firstly, the screen shone with the encounters of Reef and the other bunch of contestants when accomplishing the main mission. The crazed resistance against the arachnids in Steel Whip base….encountering a flaming beetle on the way to Whisky base….reuniting with the Roughnecks…..finally, the deaths of Johnny Rico and the other main storyline characters.\\n\\nNext, Sheyan\\'s reflection of events were much lesser. Obviously, his unorthodox path led to his abandonment of the main mission. His first reflection was the moment he killed that gigantic scourge back in Steep Whip base. The second was fast-forwarded to the moment he reached the tragic scene of the main character.

       " 'Microsoft Sells Dell\\'s Venue 8 Pro Tablet For $99\\n\\nYou\\'re unlikely to find a better Windows 8 tablet deal. How does Dell\\'s tablet stack up to the iPad?\\n\\nOn Monday, for one day only, Microsoft\\'s online store and retail locations will sell Dell\\'s Venue 8 Pro Windows 8.1 tablet for $99, an eye-opening $200 off the new device\\'s regular price. If you\\'ve been on the fence about buying a Windows tablet this holiday season, you\\'re unlikely to find many deals better than this one.\\n\\nDell\\'s 8-inch slate isn\\'t the first mini-tablet to run the full version of Windows, including desktop apps. But earlier efforts, such as Acer\\'s Iconia W3, were hampered by cheap hardware and slow processors, to say nothing of Windows 8\\'s rough edges and infamous learning curve. Dell\\'s Venue line, in contrast, has been generally well-received. Forrester analyst David Johnson told InformationWeek in October that the devices are compelling options that compare favorably to more expensive and ballyhooed options, such as Microsoft\\'s Surface tablets.\\n\\nBut you\\'ll have to act fast if you want in on this deal. The offer is good only on Monday, and each Microsoft location will sell only twenty Venue 8 Pros at $99. After that, the devices will sell for $199 - still a pretty good deal - until inventory is depleted. Microsoft\\'s online store will offer the Venue 8 Pro for $99 to the first 100 customers. After that, the cost shifts to $199 for the rest of the day or while supplies last.\\n\\n[ Buying a tablet this holiday season? Read Tablet Shopping Guide: 8 Tips. ]\\n\\nThe promotion is available only to customers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Each customer is also limited to one device.\\n\\nIn limited use, I\\'ve found the Venue 8 Pro to be snappy and responsive. Its quad-core \"Bay Trail\" processor is a noticeable improvement over previous Intel Atom chips, and though its screen doesn\\'t boast the resolution of some competing options, the device\\'s 1200x800-pixel display is still quite decent.\\n\\nDell\\'s Venue 8 Pro supports stylus and keyboard accessories.\\n\\nWindows 8.1 is also a major improvement over Windows 8. The update\\'s app-snapping multi-tasking function is particularly welcome on an 8-inch display because it allows users to split the screen evenly between two apps. In the original version of Windows 8, one app had to occupy three-quarters of the display, which made multi-tasking impractical on smaller tablets.\\n\\nOther Venue 8 Pro appeals include a preloaded copy of Office Home & Student 2013, 32 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM. It also includes a Micro USB port and can run for up to 10 hours between charges.\\n\\nAre there any reasons not to take advantage of this sale? A few.\\n\\nFor starters, buying a Windows 8.1 tablet isn\\'t the same as buying an Android or iOS tablet. They\\'re all fine for accessing the Web, sending email or watching Netflix, but if you\\'re looking for an expanded ecosystem of touch-first apps, iOS and Android still set the standard. Windows 8.1\\'s app store isn\\'t as impoverished as it was once, but the Venue 8 Pro\\'s major sales draw isn\\'t touch apps; it\\'s support for desktop software, particularly Microsoft Office.\\n\\nDoes this make the Venue 8 Pro more productive than an iPad? It depends. The Venue 8 Pro offers stylus support and can connect to third-party keyboards via Bluetooth. Dell also plans to release its own keyboard accessory soon. These tools will be useful to some, but desktop software will provide only so much utility running on such a small form factor. The Venue 8 Pro won\\'t replace a laptop, but it could be a terrific secondary device for work.\\n\\nDisplay resolution might be another concern. The Venue 8 Pro\\'s screen is serviceable-- but it\\'s also put to shame by the new iPad Mini\\'s 2048x1536-pixel Retina display. Some might also be bothered by the awkward placement of the Start button; many Windows tablets place the button beneath the screen, in the middle of the bottom bezel, but Dell counter-intuitively positioned the button on the device\\'s top-right edge. Other might be peeved that the device\\'s 10-hour battery life can only be achieved if the screen brightness is turned down; otherwise, the battery runs closer to eight hours. The Venue 8 Pro also lacks an HDMI port for connecting the tablet to a monitor or television, though Windows 8.1\\'s native Miracast support somewhat mitigates this concern.\\n\\nBut given that the device is being offered at such extreme discounts, most of these concerns are minor quibbles.\\n\\nAnd if you miss out on the Venue 8 Pro 8, don\\'t',\n",

I did once I thought about it,\" Tomaselli said. \"The minute I actually thought about it I knew it was Pittsburgh.

I\\'m 90 percent sure I did not even tell Connecticut to a police dispatcher.

He said he never knew that SU did not play UConn in the 2001-02 season until a Post-Standard reporter questioned him today. No police officials ever confronted him about that fact, Tomaselli said.\\n\\nFine, 66, who was fired by SU in November after three men publicly accused him of molesting them as children, has not been charged with any crimes.

Now some researchers—led by Aylin Caliskan-Islam, a PhD student at Drexel University—have recently discovered that this technique can be applied to code as well to determine who programmed it.\\n\\n\"Every developer has preferences not only for things like spacing (spaces vs tabs), naming styles (CamelCase vs. snake_case) and commenting, but also how he or she implements certain types of functionality,\" explains Phil Johnson in ITWorld.\\n\\nOther traits that that the researchers used included layout (such as the white space in the program) and lexical attributes (for example, counts of various types of tokens), Johnson explains. \"Their real innovation, though, was in developing what they call \\'abstract syntax trees\\' which are similar to parse trees for sentences, and are derived from language-specific syntax and keywords,\" he continues. \"These trees capture a syntactic feature set which, the authors wrote, \\'was created to capture properties of coding style that are completely independent from writing style.\\'\"\\n\\nIn other words, \"Programmers can obfuscate their variable or function names, but not the structures they subconsciously prefer to use or their favorite increment operators,\" the researchers say in a lecture about the project.\\n\\nThe technique was developed by gathering publicly available C++ source code from seven years\\' worth of Google\\'s Code Jam, an annual programming competition that attracts a wide range of programmers—more than 100,000 in total. Eventually, they achieved a 95 percent success rate, Johnson writes, which rises to 97 percent as the code sample sizes increase. The more complex the programming problem, the better success researchers had in identifying the coder, he adds.\\n\\nOf course success first requires having a known database of programmers and their code with which to compare it. This was apparently left as an exercise for the reader.\\n\\nWhy is this a big deal? Does it really matter who wrote some piece of code? It does when you consider that stylometry could be used to help identify the author of malicious source code. It might also help resolve plagiarism and copyright disputes.\\n\\n\"Source code authorship attribution could provide proof of authorship in court, automate the process of finding a cyber criminal from the source code left in an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft and plagiarism issues in the programming fields,\" the researchers write. Less seriously, it could also be used in computer programming classes to determine whether students are cheating on the assignments.\\n\\nStylometry is also being considered as a security method by organizations such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Army—where, incidentally, Caliskan-Islam served as a visiting researcher.\\n\\nIn fact, this research could put some programmers at risk, the researchers warn. Programmers could now be identified when they contribute to an open-source project—which could get sticky when they don\\'t want their employer to know. It also becomes risky to work on something embarrassing—or dangerous. \"An Iranian programmer was sentenced to death in 2012 for developing photo sharing software that was used on pornographic websites,\" researchers note. \"Sadly but predictably, there is virtually no technical difference between security-enhancing and privacy-infringing use cases.\"',\n",

She knows how to use deadly force and take down bad guys twice her size.\\n\\nBut when Compton, 29, recently found herself alone and intimidated on a recent morning, it wasn\\'t at the hands of hardened criminals. It was a group of duck hunters.\\n\\nThe Indianapolis woman had walked into a wildlife area office to sign up for her first public-lands duck hunt. She was the only woman in a room full of camouflaged men. Immediately, she felt the stares.\\n\\nAnd then, with her back turned, she heard words that made her cringe. It was a father talking to his son.\\n\\n\"As I\\'m looking at the map,\" Compton recalled, \"I can hear the dad chuckle, and he says (to his son), \\'I know what you\\'re looking at.\\' \"\\n\\nWomen are increasingly making inroads into traditionally male-dominated hunting and shooting sports. Still, stories such as Compton\\'s are common — and they illustrate a troubling hurdle for hunting groups, wildlife agencies and outdoor retailers seeking recruits to a sport that isn\\'t growing.\\n\\nBased on surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of U.S. hunters has largely stayed flat or declined in recent years, a factor hunting associations and wildlife officials blame at least in part to increased urbanization. The trend poses a particular challenge for state wildlife agencies, whose funding is almost entirely dependent on fishing and hunting license fees and taxes on hunting and shooting equipment.\\n\\n\"The very last thing you want to do is make a new hunter feel uncomfortable in a scenario like you described when she\\'s simply trying to draw for a blind,\" said Nick Pinizzotto, president and CEO of the U.S. Sportsmen\\'s Alliance, a hunting and shooting lobbying group. \"Women hunting is the best thing that could happen to our sport.\"\\n\\nAfter all, he said, female hunters — or even women who might be merely supportive of hunting — are key allies at the voting booth or in public policy debates about hunting and gun-rights issues.\\n\\n\\'Be prepared to deal with that sexism\\'\\n\\nOf the 13.7 million hunters in the U.S. in 2011, 11 percent were women — and that\\'s up from 9 percent since 2001.\\n\\nWomen also make up a growing demographic among firearms owners.\\n\\nFor example, the number of women with gun permits in Indiana jumped 42.6 percent since 2012 — from 86,617 permits two years ago to 123,536 through the first quarter of this year. The National Rifle Association estimated that about 25 percent of 70,000 attendees at its Indianapolis convention this year were women.\\n\\nWith female hunters and shooters on the rise, companies have taken notice. Women now increasingly host big-game hunting cable television shows; outdoor retailers have begun marketing products and gear designed for women; and one of the nation\\'s most venerable hunting magazines, Field & Stream, recently put a female hunter on its cover.\\n\\nBut Compton\\'s story and several others that female hunters told The Indianapolis Star illustrate the depth of the problems women face from some male hunters. Women shared with The Star not only tales of sexism and mere rudeness, but disturbing examples of sexual harassment in the field, at outdoors retailers and at conferences.\\n\\n\"Men need to be involved in changing that climate,\" said Nadya Fouad, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has studied barriers to minorities and women entering workplaces dominated by white men. \"That\\'s going to take some time.

       " \"Abstract\\n\\nThe condition of congenital amusia, commonly known as tone‐deafness, has been described for more than a century, but has received little empirical attention. In the present study, a research effort has been made to document in detail the behavioural manifestations of congenital amusia. A group of 11 adults, fitting stringent criteria of musical disabilities, were examined in a series of tests originally designed to assess the presence and specificity of musical disorders in brain‐damaged patients. The results show that congenital amusia is related to severe deficiencies in processing pitch variations. The deficit extends to impairments in music memory and recognition as well as in singing and the ability to tap in time to music. Interestingly, the disorder appears specific to the musical domain. Congenital amusical individuals process and recognize speech, including speech prosody, common environmental sounds and human voices, as well as control subjects. Thus, the present study convincingly demonstrates the existence of congenital amusia as a new class of learning disabilities that affect musical abilities.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nLanguage and music have many similarities. Notably, language and music are universal and specific to humans. Despite the complex abilities involved in both domains, linguistic and musical competence develop in the child spontaneously, without conscious effort or formal instruction. However, a few individuals suffer from severe language acquisition impairments, which are not consequent to any hearing deficiency, mental retardation or lack of environmental stimulation (e.g. Benton, 1964; Gopnik and Crago, 1991). Such a specific language impairment affects between 3 and 6% of the population (e.g. Wrightet al., 1997). Considering the similarities between music and language, we can expect that a similar proportion of individuals from the general population experience music‐specific impairments. Affected individuals would be born without the essential wiring elements for the development of a normally functioning system for music. This condition is variously termed tune‐deafness, tone‐deafness, dysmelodia or dysmusia in the literature. However, we prefer to refer to this learning disability with the less restrictive label of 'congenital amusia', because there may be as many different forms of developmental amusias as there are varieties of acquired amusias that result from accidental brain damage in adulthood.\\n\\nCongenital amusia is a condition that has been known for more than a century, since the pioneering study published by Grant‐Allen in 1878. Grant‐Allen reports the case of a 30‐year‐old man with a solid education and without neurological lesion, who suffers from a severe musical handicap. The man was unable to discriminate the pitch of two successive tones, failed to recognize familiar melodies and could not carry a tune. He exhibited an overall indifference towards music. Yet, the musical defect could not be explained by a lack of exposure to music since the man had received musical lessons during childhood (Grant‐Allen, 1879). A century later, Geshwind published a similar case (Geshwind, 1984). The case was a man who came from a musically impaired family, despite their frequent exposure to recorded music at home. As a child, this man attempted piano lessons, but his teacher soon realized that he could not sing, nor discriminate between two pitches and could not keep time. Interestingly, this same subject could speak three foreign languages fluently.\\n\\nThough indicative, these two studies are anecdotal since they are descriptive and not supported by systematic evaluations. Two large‐scale studies were run to quantify the musical disorder. In 1948, Fry evaluated a 1200 subject sample on tests requiring the subjects to compare two notes or two musical phrases in order to detect a change in pitch. From these results, Fry estimated that 5% of the British population were amusical. This author further argued that musical memory problems as well as a difficulty in pitch discrimination might be the major determinants of congenital amusia (Fry, 1948). However, these claims were not supported by data analyses. More recently, Kalmus and Fry ran another large‐scale study with 604 unselected adults who were required to detect anomalous pitches inserted in melodies (Kalmus and Fry, 1980). From these results, 4.2% of the British adult population were estimated to be amusical. However, this estimate is problematic. First, the measure lacks sensitivity since >90% of the participants were performing at ceiling. Secondly, a single measure of musical ability may have both poor validity and poor reliability. Above all, such a psychometric definition of congenital amusia is unconvincing because the sole consideration of one tail of the normal distribution on a single test does not provide convincing evidence that congenital amusia is a real affliction and not a statistical anomaly.\\n\\nIn summary, previous studies of congenital amusia provide valuable information regarding the nature of congenital amusia, while they do not offer a solid empirical basis. Thus, the major objective of the present study\",\n",

As the bear came at the man again, Dellwo recalled a story he read in a magazine.\\n\\n\"I remembered an article that my grandmother gave me a long time ago that said large animals have bad gag reflexes,\" he said. \"So I shoved my right arm down his throat.\"\\n\\nThe advice worked, and the bear left.\\n\\nDellwo rejoined his brother, who drove him to a hospital. Dellwo received stitches and staples in his head, some on his face, a swollen eye and deep puncture wounds on his leg.\\n\\n\"I want everyone to know that it wasn\\'t the bear\\'s fault. He was as scared as I was,\" Dellwo said.',\n",

       " '\"Paint it (Vanta) black\" - the world\\'s blackest material is now in spray form\\n\\n* new applications include consumer products such as cameras, and luxury goods\\n\\n* new applications include consumer products such as cameras, and luxury goods\\n\\nNewhaven, UK, March 11, 2016 --- A whole range of products can now take advantage of Vantablack\\'s astonishing characteristics, thanks to the development of a new spray version of the world\\'s blackest coating material. The new substance, Vantablack S-VIS, is easily applied at large scale to virtually any surface, whilst still delivering the proven performance of Vantablack.\\n\\nVantablack\\'s nano-structure absorbs virtually all incident light, enabling the performance of precision optical systems to be optimized. The material\\'s developer, UK-based Surrey NanoSystems, has mimicked the performance of its original Vantablack with a new version that can be sprayed onto objects, rather than deposited using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process.\\n\\nVantablack S-VIS greatly widens the potential applications space, making it possible to coat larger complex shapes and structures. It is applied at temperatures that are easily withstood by common plastics, further extending its use. Even though the material is applied using a simple spraying process, it traps a massive 99.8% of incident light. This property gives Vantablack S-VIS its ability to make objects appear to be two-dimensional black holes, as it becomes impossible to make-out surface topography.\\n\\nThe only other commercially-available material that is darker than the new S-VIS version is original Vantablack, which set a world record for absorption of light at a staggering 99.965%. Vantablack was originally developed for satellite-borne earth observation imaging and calibration systems, where it increases instrument sensitivity by improving absorption of stray ultraviolet, visible and infrared light. Since then, many other applications have emerged, including solar-energy collector elements, functional surfaces in buildings and architecture, cinematographic projectors, high-performance baffles and lenses, and scientific instruments. Its ability to deceive the eye also opens-up a range of design-possibilities to enhance styling and appearance in luxury goods and jewellery.\\n\\n\"The original Vantablack coating has had a big impact on the market, and is helping many companies to bring out higher-performing equipment,\" says Ben Jensen of Surrey NanoSystems. \"We are continuing to develop the technology, and the new sprayable version really does open up the possibility of applying super-black coatings in many more types of airborne or terrestrial applications. Possibilities include commercial products such as cameras, equipment requiring improved performance in a smaller form factor, as well as differentiating the look of products by means of the coating\\'s unique aesthetic appearance. It\\'s a major step forward compared with today\\'s commercial absorber coatings.\"\\n\\nVantablack S-VIS is so effective that its performance far outstrips that of any other conventionally-applied coating, typically achieving a reflectance of less than 0.2%. Unlike other black absorbers, it offers this exceptional performance across a wide-range of viewing angles and wavelengths, which is critical for optical instruments, as well as in many aesthetic applications. It is, for example, some 17 times less reflective than the super-black paint used for minimizing stray light in the Hubble space telescope.\\n\\nThe active element of Vantablack S-VIS is a carbon nanotube matrix. The coating is applied using a proprietary process that includes a number of pre- and post-application steps to achieve its ultra-low reflectance.\\n\\nVantablack S-VIS can be applied to most stable surfaces, with the only major constraint being the ability to withstand temperatures of 100 degrees Centigrade, making Vantablack S-VIS suitable for many types of engineering-grade polymers and composite materials. The process is scalable and suitable for high-volume production on a range of substrate sizes.\\n\\nThe structured surface of Vantablack S-VIS means that it is not recommended for applications where it is subject to physical contact or abrasion. Ideally, it should be applied to surfaces that are protected, either within a packaged product, or behind a glass or other protective layer.\\n\\nCoating with Vantablack S-VIS is offered as a service from Surrey NanoSystems\\' processing centre in the UK. It is also available under license to companies wishing to integrate the coating into their production processes.\\n\\nENDS\\n\\nMedia contact: Ben Jensen, t: +44 (0) 1273 515899\\n\\nJournalists have permission to use any picture from this article or from our pictures page as long as they are attributed to Surrey NanoSystems\\n\\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\\n\\nA few of Vantablack S-VIS\\'s technical specifications:\\n\\n* THR (total hemispherical',\n",

       " 'CINCINNATI -- It\\'s been more than 60 years since legendary actress and singer Doris Day lived in Cincinnati, yet she stole the show last month during a Cincinnati City Council meeting.\\n\\nCouncilman P.G. Sittenfeld led a 25-minute presentation, displaying life-size photos of the smiling superstar at City Hall and playing a video presentation on the Cincinnati native\\'s life for fellow council members. And 25 minutes later, council voted to rename a city street in her honor – Doris Day Way.\\n\\nIt was a sentimental gesture to recognize a famous Cincinnatian. But it is also an increasingly common way for City Council to spend its time as Election Day nears.\\n\\nSo far in 2017, as most of council faces re-election, it has renamed 20 streets to celebrate history or honor notable residents such as Buddy LaRosa and Bootsy Collins.\\n\\nMeanwhile bigger issues, such as what to do about the dilapidated Police District 5 and the number of cancer diagnoses of officers who work there, seem to simmer without much attention.\\n\\nThe Doris Day presentation came just a day after another officer had been diagnosed with cancer while city leaders delayed plans to move officers from the troubled District 5 building for months.\\n\\nIt prompted Hamilton County Republican Party Chair Alex Triantafilou to tweet \"While @CityOfCincy PD faces a real crisis in Dist. 5, your council is enjoying pictures of Doris Day. Get Serious.\"\\n\\nWhile @CityOfCincy PD faces a real crisis in Dist. 5, your council is enjoying pictures of Doris Day. Get serious. — Alex Triantafilou (@ChairmanAlex) September 27, 2017\\n\\nWith the election weeks away, and six of the nine council members running for re-election, WCPO examined the number of resolutions it passed that don\\'t change city policy in any way.\\n\\nFor example, in 2017, City Council passed 17 resolutions voicing their opinions on a range of state and national topics, such as the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the nation\\'s withdrawal from the Paris Climate agreement.\\n\\nCouncilman Charlie Winburn chided his fellow council members for spending the bulk of a 28-minute meeting in September talking about President Donald Trump\\'s order to end a policy allowing children of immigrants to stay in the United States legally.\\n\\nHe ticked off a number of issues – from the streetcar\\'s operating budget to the heroin epidemic – that City Council should spend time on instead.\\n\\n\"Our time is better spent on these issues,\" Winburn said. \"We are not being fair to Cincinnatians when we focus on taking symbolic stands on national issues.\"\\n\\nCouncilman Charles Winburn speaks during a Cincinnati City Council meeting on Oct. 18, 2017. Photo by Leigh Taylor\\n\\nAnd taking a stance on national issues – particularly with a controversial president like Trump -- can be a good way for some council members to win favor with their base.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re Chris Seelbach and you\\'re saying things that appeal to a group of liberals in the community, they\\'re happy when you speak out against (Donald) Trump,\" said Mack Mariani, chair of Xavier University\\'s political science department. \"They\\'re thinking: \\'This Seelbach guy is thinking exactly what I\\'m thinking.\\'\"\\n\\nIt\\'s not just national issues that have sucked up council\\'s time.\\n\\nThey\\'ve spent plenty of time taking up political causes, such as promoting Genocide Awareness Month or opposing Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.\\n\\nOver their nearly four-year term, members created 68 resolutions recognizing citizen achievements – from marathon runners to Food Network cooking champions, often with speeches and lengthy presentations.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a value in recognizing our history and a value in celebrating the good feeling people have for the city and its people,\" said University of Cincinnati political science professor David Niven. \"But it can only be a part of the job. … When it\\'s a regular, reoccurring and often central accomplishment of the day, that\\'s where it becomes a reason to be concerned.\"\\n\\nCouncilman Chris Seelbach routinely honors city residents during LGBT Pride Month and Councilwoman Yvette Simpson does the same for Black History Month, as a way to recognize important achievements.\\n\\nSittenfeld has had a busy and productive year on City Council – from new policy that forces banks to maintain foreclosed properties to launching a \\'Golden Cincinnati\\' Initiative that created an aging and accessibility czar at City Hall. He also spearheaded an idea to use technology to solve the heroin crisis.\\n\\nThe resolutions he\\'s sponsored are just another way to respond to his constituents, he said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever done a resolution without someone in the community saying \\'This is really important,\\'\" Sittenfeld said. \"It takes almost no time, and it\\'s almost always in response to sincere citizens who care about issues and want their elected leadership to take a position.\"',\n",
       " \"Abstract\\n\\nHemispherectomy has been performed in the treatment of epilepsy in association with hemiplegia for over 50 years. However, the optimal timing of surgery with respect to age at presentation and the influence of underlying pathology on outcome is only slowly emerging. This study reports on the clinical course and outcomes of 33 children who underwent hemispherectomy at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, between 1991 and 1997. Age at surgery was 0.33–17 years (median 4.25) with 1–8 years follow‐up (median 3.4). The underlying pathology was developmental in 16 (10 hemimegalencephaly, two polymicrogyria, two focal cortical dysplasia, one diffuse cortical dysplasia and one microdysgenesis), acquired in 11 (six middle cerebral artery infarct, three post encephalitis/trauma, and one each of hemiconvulsion–hemiplegia epilepsy and perinatal ischaemic insult) and progressive in six children (four Rasmussen encephalitis, two Sturge–Weber syndrome). At follow‐up, 52% were seizure free, 9% experienced rare seizures, 30% showed >75% reduction in seizures and 9% showed <75% seizure reduction or no improvement. Seizure freedom was highest in those with acquired pathology (82%), followed by those with progressive pathology (50%) and those with developmental pathology (31%). However, seizure freedom, rare seizures or >75% reduction in seizures occurred in 100% of those with progressive pathology, 91% of those with acquired and 88% of those with developmental pathology, indicating a worthwhile seizure outcome in all groups. Hemiplegia remained unchanged following surgery in 22 out of 33 children, improved in five and was worse in six. No significant cognitive deterioration or loss of language occurred, and four children showed significant cognitive improvement. Behavioural improvement was reported in 92% of those who had behaviour problems pre‐operatively.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nHemispherectomy was described independently in 1928 by Dandy and L'Hermitte (Rasmussen, 1983) as a radical treatment for malignant glioma of one hemisphere, but with a failure to offer improvements in survival or quality of life compared with more conservative treatments. Further interest in the procedure followed the publication in 1950 (Krynauw, 1950) of a study of a series of 12 children with infantile hemiplegia, seizures and behaviour disorders who underwent hemispherectomy for epilepsy with good seizure outcome. The popularity of anatomical hemispherectomy subsequently declined in the late 1960s because of the delayed complications of the procedure (Oppenheimer and Griffith, 1966; Till, 1967; Brett, 1969), which included obstructive hydrocephalus, superficial haemosiderosis and intracranial haematomata in as many as 33% patients (Rasmussen, 1983). However, a modification of the procedure (Adams, 1983) and the development of the sub‐total or functional hemispherectomy (Rasmussen, 1983; Tinuper et al., 1988) largely abolished these complications.\\n\\nHemispherectomy can be considered for those with seizures arising from one hemisphere where there is a pre‐existing structural abnormality of that hemisphere. It is particularly suitable for those with a pre‐existing hemiplegia and/or visual field deficit, a group in whom co‐existing cognitive and behavioural impairments are common. However, it may be offered to those without such disabilities in circumstances such as Rasmussen syndrome, where inevitable deterioration in epilepsy is accompanied by deterioration of both motor and intellectual performance (Vining et al., 1997) and where lesser resections are unsuccessful (Platt et al., 1988).\\n\\nThe effectiveness of hemispherectomy for epilepsy associated with congenital hemiplegia was initially evaluated by the degree of seizure relief it offered (the traditional outcome measure used in adult epilepsy surgery). Seizure outcome was impressive but positive effects on cognition and behaviour were increasingly reported and were replicated by other groups in the 269 published reports of the procedure by 1961 (Rasmussen, 1983). The cognitive and behavioural impairments associated with congenital hemiplegia may be profound, especially for those with very early onset epilepsy and dysplastic lesions in whom development appears to remain arrested until clinical and sub‐clinical seizure activity is abolished. Such secondary impairments, which constitute the severe epileptic encephalopathy suffered by these children, are emerging as the main target for epilepsy surgery in childhood. The aim is to offer surgery at a younger age in order to maximise the beneficial effects on developmental trajectory. This aim challenges our ability both to predict outcome and to justify major surgery in very young children. In the context of clinical decision‐making, it would be very difficult to randomize to early or late surgery. At this stage, therefore, we have to analyse our attempts to address these issues in the clinical setting and this is the main purpose of this study. We report the clinical outcomes of hemispherect\",\n",

A number of friends revere his work, and a particular online literary review zine, which must remain nameless or the review gets redlined at Amazon, championed his stuff as long as I read them. And given a title like Lockpick Pornography, I figured, how can you go wrong? Now, the book and its sequel are slated to be published in an omnibus volume from ECW Press, so what better time to write this review? (I actually finished the blessed thing last summer while on a roadtrip to visit relatives.)\\n\\n\\nAs you may be able to surmise from the opening paragraph, I wanted to like this book. I wanted a good deal to like this book. But somehow I never got round to it. I didn\\'t dislike it, mind you, but it never reached out and grabbed me. Normally, I\\'d give the writer of such a thing the benefit of the doubt, but I\\'m not going to in this case; I\\'m pretty sure the problem doesn\\'t lie with me here. Comeau has a lot of big ideas, and it\\'s really quite commendable that he\\'s going to attempt to tackle them. The problem is, he never actually does. I\\'m not sure whether he\\'s just throwing stuff out there with the belief that \"if you\\'re reading this book, you probably feel the same way I do about these things, so I really don\\'t need to go into any detail\" (which, at best, would be hopelessly naïve), simply using this stuff as plot device (which, at best, would be exploitative), or throwing it in simply for shock value (in which case, this would be bizarro fiction, but not as accomplished as the better bizarro authors). I toyed around with possibility #3 for about a week after finishing the book before throwing it out; there\\'s enough passion in the places where Comeau makes an attempt at addressing all this stuff—the raging anti-capitalism, the gender dysphoria (and inventive ways his characters have of dealing with that), the sometimes-irresistable urge to take your experimental novel and turn it into a genre noir thriller—that I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s not just trolling. And #2 doesn\\'t quite feel right, either, and for much the same reason; I\\'m not sure someone using gender dysphoria solely as a plot device would be able to handle it with Comeau\\'s sardonic-but-not-cruel take.\\n\\n\\nWhich leaves me with choice #1, but I kind of feel like a heel employing it, no matter how naïve the resulting novel turns out to be.\\n\\n\\nThe unfortunate part about it is that author naïvete turns into character shallowness, as no one in the novel ever gives even the most passing thought to why they\\'re all doing this. In his defense, I should say that it seems Comeau either attempts and fails, or had thought about attempting and then abandoned the idea, to rectify this in the book\\'s climactic sequence; I was planning on going on with that statement, but then realized we\\'d be well into spoiler alert territory, so trust me on this one.\\n\\n\\nI haven\\'t yet read any of Comeau\\'s more recent, and much more popular novels (my local public library, which is notorious for carrying very little other than Stephen King and Danielle Steel, even has a copy of One Bloody Thing After Another!), so I can\\'t just pop out some sort of wry comment about how Lockpick Pornography is a rough early example of the style of etc., and yet for some reason I want to; that\\'s what it feels like, anyway. It\\'s very much a style-over-substance book, and I\\'d imagine it will have a great deal of appeal to the twenty-first-century version of the disaffected youth who flocked to see movies like Been Down So Long It Feels Like Up to Me back in the seventies. Be aware, however, you will have to fill in a number of wide, unbridged gaps that it doesn\\'t seem to me you should have to. ** ½',\n",
       " 'Meat and cheese lovers may have gotten excited recently when an article in the Washington Post was published with the headline \"Atkins diet\\'s return reflects idea that saturated fat shouldn\\'t be demonized.\"\\n\\nNo doubt the Washington Post got excited, too, because there\\'s no better way to pick up flagging newspaper sales than to tell people that it\\'s okay to eat the foods they love.\\n\\nSorry, Washington Post, but it\\'s NOT okay to eat foods high in saturated fat like red meat, cheese, butter, and full-fat ice cream.\\n\\nIs saturated fat bad for you and your heart? Yes.\\n\\nWe know beyond any reasonable doubt that increased saturated fat intake raises LDL cholesterol levels; and over time, higher LDL levels promote more atheroclerosis and cardiovascular-related mortality.\\n\\nTo bolster this ridiculous claim, the Post referred repeatedly to a study published in the March issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study analyzed several epidemiological studies (the studies\\' lengths ranged from 5 to 23 years) and found no significant evidence that dietary saturated fat is linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the problem: It has always been very difficult to find any significant correlation between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease using epidemiological data within a given population. The reason is not because a correlation does not exist but because of the way people\\'s eating habits are measured. In these epidemiological studies, scientists used dietary recall data, \"but dietary recall data are very inaccurate,\" points out Dr. Jay Kenney, Nutrition Research Specialist at the Pritikin Longevity Center.\\n\\nIn numerous investigations on the efficacy of 24-hour dietary records, scientists have found that the majority of people cannot estimate their food intake, or forget what they have eaten, or outright lie (Who wants to admit they wolfed down two cheeseburgers for lunch?).\\n\\nAnd even when 24-hour food recalls are fairly accurate, they are still highly suspect as a measurement of people\\'s overall food intake.\\n\\nFirst of all, people often eat very different amounts of saturated fat from day to day. The day they recorded their sat fat intake may have been the day they had bean chili for dinner. The next day (the day that was not recorded) may have ended with a sirloin steak and crème brulee.\\n\\nSecondly, people often change their diets over time, especially in industrialized countries like the U.S. Hence, what their daily diet was at the beginning of a 10-year study may have changed significantly two, three, or five years into the study.\\n\\n\"The point is: When your measurements of dietary variables are very inaccurate – and when you have no scientific tool to measure subjects\\' eating habits over long periods of time – the odds of finding a significant correlation, even if one exists, go way down,\" states Dr. Kenney.\\n\\nOf course, if we study the actual cultures and eating habits of populations that we know eat far less saturated fat over their lifetimes, we see much lower levels of cholesterol in these populations, and much lower levels of cardiovascular events like heart attacks.\\n\\nHere are two examples:\\n\\nOkinawa\\n\\nResearchers traveled to Okinawa and for years tracked the daily eating habits of the people living on this island off the coast of Japan. It was easy to confirm that Okinawa\\'s people ate very little saturated fat because there wasn\\'t much of the fat on the island to begin with. The population followed a diet (as they had for centuries) that was high in unrefined carbohydrates like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. They ate up to 20 servings of unrefined carbohydrates daily. Staples included sweet potatoes, dark green vegetables, green peppers, rice, fresh fruit, tofu (and other forms of soy), as well as seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids. While fish made up about 11% of the diet, only about 3% came from saturated-fat-containing foods like poultry and meat.\\n\\nOn this very low-in-saturated-fat diet, Okinawa\\'s citizens were found to have 80% fewer heart attacks than Americans. They were also lean (Take that, Atkins diet proponents), averaging a body mass index of just 22. There\\'s more good news: They had (and still have) the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world. They also have the highest percentage of citizens over the age of 100. Is there a correlation here between low-in-saturated-fat diets and very low rates of heart disease? You bet.\\n\\nThe China Study\\n\\nHeralded as the most comprehensive study of diet and disease ever conducted, the China Study by Cornell University scientists looked at 16,700 individuals in the 65 provinces of China over a six-year period in the 1980s. It examined more than 1,000 separate diet, lifestyle, and environmental aspects relating to each of the subjects.\\n\\nThe provinces with the least amount of cardiovascular disease were those following a very low-',\n",

       " 'News Releases from Region 09\\n\\nU.S. EPA recognizes food recovery efforts in California\\n\\nWinners from Daly City, North Hollywood and San Diego area receive awards\\n\\nContact Information: Nahal Mogharabi (mogharabi.nahal@epa.gov) 213-244-1815\\n\\nLOS ANGELES – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is recognizing the outstanding accomplishments of seven California winners participating in EPA\\'s Food Recovery Challenge. Winners include Sprouts Farmers Markets in Daly City and Carlsbad, Calif., Ramona High School in Ramona, Calif., Food Forward in North Hollywood, Calif., Cherokee Point Elementary School in San Diego, Calif., the City of San Diego and the San Diego International Airport.\\n\\n\"Food Recovery Challenge award winners serve as role models in their communities and for other organizations,\" said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. \"Their hard work and effective efforts to divert wasted food from landfills is paying off through social, financial and environmental benefits. I encourage other organizations to replicate the successful food recovery operations of our Challenge winners.\"\\n\\nEPA recognizes Food Recovery Challenge participants and endorsers with awards in two categories: data-driven and narrative. The data-driven award recipients achieved the highest percent increases in their sector comparing year-to-year data. Narrative award winners excelled in the areas of source reduction, leadership, innovation, education and outreach and endorsement. Nationally, 16 participants received awards. The seven winners in California were:\\n\\nData-driven Improvement by Sector Winners:\\n\\nSprouts Farmers Market\\n\\nGrocer: Carlsbad Store\\n\\nNewcomer: Daly City Store\\n\\nSprouts acts on their commitment to Zero Food Waste through their Food Rescue and Food Waste to Farms programs, and through customer engagement, preventing more than 31 million pounds of wasted food from entering landfills and avoiding more than $1.5 million in landfill fees in 2016. Team members participate in training on the importance of food donations in the community, proper shrink management, and guidelines for donations. In 2016, Sprouts was able to provide more than 19 million pounds of nutritious foods to its communities, resulting in nearly 16 million meals. Through its various initiatives, Sprouts has developed successful business-to-business and non-profit relationships that illustrate the power of partnerships to reduce environmental impacts and eliminate hunger in communities.\\n\\nK-12 Schools: Ramona High School (Ramona)\\n\\nRamona High School\\'s Eco-Leaders, in collaboration with the County of San Diego and the Ramona Unified School District, run a district-wide, collaborative wasted-food reduction and composting program. Students weigh, measure, chart and keep accurate data from eight school sites. The data is sent electronically to the County each day. Nutrition staff reported revisions to their food preparation practices after seeing how much food was going to waste. Prepared food suitable for donation is placed in a walk-in freezer and collected weekly by a local pantry and distributed to the underserved in the community.\\n\\nNon-Profits: Food Forward (North Hollywood)\\n\\nFood Forward rescues fresh local produce that would otherwise go to waste. Produce is collected from over 750 private backyards, 22 weekly farmers\\' markets, and the downtown Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market. In 2016, the Wholesale Recovery program rescued over 13.7 million pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables. This produce would have otherwise been sent to landfill. One hundred percent of the recovered food is donated, within hours, to hunger relief agencies across eight counties in Southern California. In 2016, Food Forward helped feed 1.25 million individuals facing food insecurity.\\n\\nNarrative Category Winners:\\n\\nSource Reduction: Cherokee Point Elementary School (San Diego)\\n\\nCherokee Point Elementary School is a leader when it comes to reducing and diverting wasted food. With an enrollment of approximately 400 students, all receiving free and reduced price meals, Cherokee Point is committed to reducing wasted food at the source. The school accurately forecasted the amount of food needed for student meals by using the \"offer versus serve\" model which allows students to decline some of the items offered that they don\\'t intend to consume, recovered certain foods and beverages to use in another meal service, and reduced salad bar pan size. Additionally, students separate their food scraps at lunch so they can be sent off-site for composting.\\n\\nLeadership: City of San Diego (San Diego)\\n\\nThe City of San Diego\\'s Environmental Services Department\\'s Commercial Food Waste Diversion Program has a comprehensive food recovery education program for commercial food providers. The program had over 80 participants in 2016, composting nearly 8,000 tons of wasted food. Participants included the largest generators of food waste in the city, and all its larger venues, such as the Convention Center, Zoo, Safari Park and SeaWorld San Diego, took part. During 2016, 17 of the larger generators alone increased their food donation by over 3,000 pounds per week.',\n",
       " 'Dear Ms. Kaminer,\\n\\nI read your article, What to Make of the Rape Accusations at Amherst College, today, and I feel it necessary to express how disappointed I am. If there\\'s a subcategory in rape culture that angers me most, it\\'s victim blaming. The harm that comes from blaming a survivor of sexual assault is so substantial, that it often is as traumatic as the assault itself. The blatant mocking of Epifano that occurs throughout your article is simply unacceptable:\\n\\n\"Put aside questions about the accuracy of Epifano\\'s recollections and the soundness or gross insensitivity of the counselor\\'s advice. Never mind the absence of discussion about reporting the alleged attack to law enforcement; rape is, after all, a felony, which courts are better equipped to address than colleges. Focus instead on Epifano\\'s reaction to the prospect of a disciplinary hearing: Hours locked in a room with him and being called a liar about being raped? No, thank you. I could barely handle seeing him from the opposite end of campus; I knew I couldn\\'t handle that level of negativity.\"\\n\\nYou see, Ms. Kaminer, Epifano denied even the thought of going through a trial in order to protect herself. Maybe that seems ridiculous to you, but sometimes after going through a terrible trauma, one cannot possibly bear the thought of recounting that trauma over and over. Also, Epifano may or may not have known this, but out of every 100 rapes, 46 get reported to the police, 12 lead to an arrest, 9 are prosecuted, 5 lead to a felony conviction, and 3 rapists will spend a single day in prison*. The long and frustrating battle to hope that your rapist is not one of the 97% who walk takes a toll on survivors that Epifano didn\\'t want to subject herself to.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s okay. What you need to realize is that it\\'s okay for Epifano to put herself first. If she didn\\'t feel like she could handle an entire trial, then let\\'s applaud her honesty and willingness to listen to her own needs, instead of criticizing her because you or someone else would\\'ve \"done differently.\" In reality no one knows, not even another survivor, of what she\\'s endured.\\n\\nYou then go on to question the trauma she felt from her rape:\\n\\n\"Is rape necessarily this traumatic? Are all rapes equal in the damage they inflict? Yes, according to some popular feminist wisdom. No, according to the diverse experiences of rape victims I\\'ve known — including women who\\'ve been raped while hitchhiking and by strangers who broke in to their apartments, as well as women raped by dates or acquaintances… I\\'m not criticizing or judging Epifano for being acutely frightened and depressed. I\\'m not presuming to tell women how they should or shouldn\\'t react to being raped. Quite the opposite. I\\'m simply suggesting that different women react differently, according to their different circumstances, strengths and vulnerabilities. I\\'m not denying the horrors of rape and the outrage, shame, or fear it can engender, but I am questioning the assumption that it naturally and inevitably breaks women down. I\\'m wondering if that assumption isn\\'t sometimes self-fulfilling.\"\\n\\nFirst, I\\'d be willing to bet that the source you have for that \"popular feminist wisdom\" is incorrect. The feminist approach to rape crisis intervention is letting the survivor know their options and empowering them to make those decisions themselves, in order to put control back in their lives. Secondly, every person reacts entirely differently from any other person who\\'s been raped. You say you understand this, just to go ahead and question the assumption that rape \"naturally and inevitably breaks women down.\" For some, yes, it breaks them down. For others, they can go on with their daily lives as if a rape never happened. One can never assume any reaction from any survivor.\\n\\nEpifano, no matter her decisions or reactions from her rape, did what she could in order to survive. Maybe you don\\'t agree with how she went about it, but she knows herself better than you do, so stop judging her. She is strong and brave and an inspiration. Angie Epifano is a survivor.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nChelcie Laggis, founder of endrapeculture.com',\n",
       " 'According to the RID Annual Reports, the pass rate of the NIC is quickly dropping, from 77% in 2010 to a shocking 26% in 2014. With the current iteration of the NIC, the pass rate has dropped to nearly half that of the first year it was available (51% in 2011). This decline suggests that the current exam is invalid, and many are concerned that the testing format of 4-minute vignettes does not sufficiently mimic real-life interpreting scenarios.\\n\\nDr. Dennis Cokely sent a letter to the RID board in 2012 raising valid questions about the enhanced NIC exam. To quote Dr. Cokely:\\n\\n\"A clear, empirically supported explanation of why the current NIC assessment is valid and can be reliably assessed by raters must be provided to the membership.\"\\n\\n(Click here to read his letter that explains his - and our - concerns in detail.)\\n\\nMore and more states are turning to licensing as a way to protect clients from unqualified signers, and often the requirement for licensure is RID certification. Therefore, it is imperative that we have a reliable and valid exam in place. We recognize that RID is in the process of assembling a certification task force, but we feel the following points need to be addressed with urgency:\\n\\nDetermine NIC exam validity and establish full transparency about the testing process\\n\\nIf the test is deemed invalid, develop a new test\\n\\nPublish the NIC rubric so candidates may properly prepare before testing\\n\\nProvide more in-depth, personalized feedback on test results\\n\\nOffer certification process extensions to candidates until a valid test is in place\\n\\nThese actions will help ensure competent interpreters aren\\'t forced out of the profession due to an invalid certification process.\\n\\nOur goal is to get as many signatures as possible before August 7th, so that the petition can be seen at the RID National Conference. If you choose to sign this petition, we encourage you to use the \"I\\'m signing because…\" box to explain to the RID board why this is important to you, as well as indicate if you are an RID member.',\n",
       " 'Goldstone says: \"To echo Nigel\\'s concerns, we have seen kind of a corporatization of what\\'s going on on State Street, and unfortunately, the sad part of it is, the Orpheum has now been a part of that. I mean, a lot of people don\\'t know this, but earlier this summer the Orpheum Theatre signed an exclusive booking arrangement with Live Nation Entertainment. For people who don\\'t know who Live Nation is, it\\'s a publicly traded mega-corporation based out of Beverly Hills, California, who doesn\\'t have a single full-time employee in the state of Wisconsin. In the industry they\\'re referred to as the Wal-Mart of promoters because they\\'ve basically built a business going into cities and either acquiring and downsizing local independent promoters like Frank Productions or simply running them out of business. And it\\'s sad to see the Orpheum allow them into our market to attempt that as well.\" He then goes on to tout the still-unnamed new Frank venue as being locally owned and operated.\\n\\nIt\\'s a little surprising that he\\'s so openly critical of Live Nation, because Frank has co-presented shows with Live Nation, and there are still Frank Productions shows for which you can buy tickets through Ticketmaster, which is part of Live Nation.\\n\\nOrpheum general manager Perry Blanchard, who was also a guest on the segment, counters: \"First of all, the ownership of the theater is still local. We have a booking arrangement, and the person that books our room books the House of Blues in Chicago, and Billboard\\'s just put out a list yesterday of the top 25 clubs in America, and the House of Blues Chicago was number 5. And when we were looking for people to book our room, we had many conversations with a lot of promoters, and Live Nation came to us and they were the most realistic about what they expected from our venue. And the reason we went with Live Nation was because we want the ownership of this theater to stay local, and we need events in our room to keep it thriving, and they\\'re driving so much business into our room right now that we couldn\\'t be happier with their involvement. And ultimately, with what the Franks had coming down the pipe, we needed to have the best company to help us compete with what was coming down the line.\"\\n\\nBlanchard later adds: \"You can say what you want about Live Nation but they\\'re the best at what they do, and we\\'re certainly happy to have them on board with us.\"\\n\\nAnyhow, not entirely surprising to hear a business criticize a competitor, but it\\'s a bit more heated than I would have expected. The segment overall is worth a listen—good on O\\'Shea for asking some hard questions and stirring up the conversation.',\n",
       " 'Whether they are senior citizens, middle-aged fathers or barely able to drink legally, all men are inherently attracted to young women who are in their early 20s.\\n\\nIn his book Dataclysm: Love, Sex, Race, and Identity - What Our Online Lives Tell Us About Our Offline Selves, author and OKCupid co-founder Christian Rudder used the data preferences found on his dating site to determine that men find women between the ages of 20 and 24 most attractive - no matter how old they get.\\n\\nAfter [a man] hits thirty, the latter half of [OKCupid\\'s] age range (that is, women over 35) might as well not exist,\\' Christian explained in an excerpt of his book, which was shared on Jezebel.\\n\\nScroll down for video\\n\\nPretty young things: OKCupid co-founder Christian Rudder used the data from his site to determine that men think women look best when they are between the ages of 20 and 24\\n\\n\\'Younger is better, and youngest is best of all, and if \"over the hill\" means the beginning of a person\\'s decline, a straight woman is over the hill as soon as she\\'s old enough to drink,\\' he noted.\\n\\nA majority of the groups of men between the ages of 20 and 50 prefer women to be 20, while 21 was the next highest reported age.\\n\\nAnd only one age group, 45, chose 24, the highest age reported, as the one that looks best to them.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Christian found that women want a \\'guy to be roughly as old as she is\\'.\\n\\nYounger is better, and youngest is best of all\\n\\n\\'This isn\\'t survey data, this is data built from tens of millions of preferences expressed in the act of finding a date,\\' he said.\\n\\nAccording to his research, women like men to be slightly older than them until they hit their 30s. Then they become interested in men who are their own age or slightly younger. By their 40s, women are most attracted to men who are two to eight years younger than they are.\\n\\n\\'If we want to pick the point where a man\\'s sexual appeal has reached its limit, it\\'s there: 40,\\' Christian noted.\\n\\nBut an eight year age difference is nothing compared to the 28-year age gap between 50-year-old men who think 22-year-old women are ideal.\\n\\n\\'Another way to put this focus on youth is that males\\' expectations never grow up,\\' Christian wrote. \\'A 50-year-old man\\'s idea of what\\'s hot is roughly the same as a college kid\\'s.\\'\\n\\nHowever, there is no need to despair.

       " 'In a warming world, we expect to see increases in some extreme weather events. The science is pretty clear that in some parts of the world, drought and heat waves have and will continue to increase. In other areas, more severe storms along with precipitation and flooding have increased. Drought, heat waves, and floods are examples of changes to weather and climate patterns that will have costs for human society.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s tricky to discern not only whether past extreme weather have changed, but also whether human-caused global warming is a factor. Scientists need high-quality records that go back many decades to see if there is any trend towards increasing or decreasing extreme weather. But weather is quite variable. We can see a rise or fall in extreme weather events with no apparent cause, human or natural.\\n\\n\\nWhile these trends tend to be shorter (over days, weeks, or perhaps months), some trends can have longer durations. How can we identify trends prior to high-quality instrumentation and how can we discern whether the extreme weather we see now is within natural variability? Those are the questions addressed in a new publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research by lead author Dr. Benjamin Cook and his colleagues.\\n\\nThe title of the article, \"Spatiotemporal drought variability in the Mediterranean over the last 900 years\" clearly indicates that this study considers almost a millennium of drought records and focuses attention on the Mediterranean region.\\n\\nThe authors use a powerful database called the Old World Drought Atlas to look back in time prior to modern instruments. This atlas is a collection of tree-ring data that measures drought using the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Within the Mediterranean region, there are 106 different tree-ring datasets. These datasets go back various lengths of time but since 1100 CE, the region is accurately sampled.\\n\\n\\nThe Palmer Drought Severity Index accounts for changes in precipitation as well as changes in evaporation and storage of water within soils. By using this measurement, the authors are able to find multiple droughts throughout the Mediterranean region. Often times, the droughts occur simultaneously in different parts of the region. For instance, droughts are likely to occur at the same in in both the Western Mediterranean (Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and in the east (e.g. Greece and Turkey).\\n\\nWhat did the authors find regarding the recent droughts in the Mediterranean? Well in recent decades, there has been a persistent and long-duration drought in the regions of Greece and the Levant region. The authors found that although the Greek droughts have been severe, they do not deviate from droughts that have been observed in the past.\\n\\nIn the Levant region, the recent drought (1998–2012) exceeds what they have seen in the past 900 years. In fact, the recent drought is likely the driest period in the last 900 years and very likely the driest period in the last 500 years.\\n\\nHere is what Dr. Cook told me:\\n\\nTo really understand the extent to which climate change is affecting extreme events, like droughts, you need to understand the full range of natural variability. This is why paleoclimate is so important - it gives us a way to extend our understanding way past the relatively short instrumental record of the last 100 to 150 years. In this study, we found that the recent drought in the Levant region of the eastern Mediterranean is likely worse than any comparable period of the last 900 years. This provides some independent support for other studies that have argued that climate change is intensifying drying in the region.\\n\\nTo be clear, this study doesn\\'t prove that droughts are getting worse, and it doesn\\'t prove that human emissions of greenhouse gases are making droughts more severe. In fact, proving such statements would be nearly impossible. What this study does is put recent extreme weather into historical context.\\n\\nWe know human carbon emissions will warm the world. We know that a warmer world affects precipitation and evaporation and this should affect droughts. We are observing that recent droughts are likely to worst on record. We also know that droughts and other extreme weather events have tremendous societal and economic consequences.\\n\\nWas the recent extreme Mediterranean drought caused by us? Probably. Or, if not caused by us, certainly made worse. Can we prove it? Probably not. However, it is clear to people like myself that study this topic that we have enough information to make decisions about the future planet we want to live in. It is clear that if we want to avoid further increases in extreme weather, we need to reduce our emissions of global-warming gases.',\n",
       " 'At long last, the numbers have been revealed about the sale of President Trump\\'s boyhood home, located in a pleasant neighborhood of Queens, New York. The attractive Tudor home was sold five days ago to an unnamed buyer for $2.14 million — a tidy 54 percent profit for Michael Davis, the local real estate investor who purchased the property for $1.39 million through public auction only three months ago. He was praised by the press for \"flipping\" the property, built in 1940 by Mr. Trump\\'s father Fred C. Trump, himself a real estate developer.\\n\\nThere is reason to fuss over the five-bedroom home. It could very well be declared a historic property, or become a lucrative tourist destination. There is always intrigue, though. Both the New York Times and New York Daily News note that the lawyer who represented the buyer \"is known to represent Chinese investors.\" If that proves to be true, there will be a media frenzy over a \"Chinese connection,\" or words to that effect — so stand by. Meanwhile, the property remains a cozy house, and Mr. Trump has publicly revealed that he still loves it.\\n\\n\"This property is so much more than just real estate; it\\'s the childhood home of the 45th president of the United States, and it\\'s a part of history. That intangible value makes it a perfect example of why special properties are appropriately sold by auction, just like art is. As they say, beauty is truly in the eyes of the beholder,\" notes Misha Haghani, founder of Paramount Realty USA, which managed the transaction. Find the home here.\\n\\nTHE TRUMP TOUCH\\n\\n\"Donald Trump gets it. He really gets it,\" says an appreciative Joseph Bast, president of The Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based nonprofit that favors free-market solutions to social and economic challenges.\\n\\n\"At the signing ceremony for his \\'Energy Independence Executive Order\\' Wednesday, President Trump stood surrounded by coal miners, talked to them like the real people they are, and thanked them for what they do,\" Mr. Bast continues, citing Mr. Trump\\'s vow to put the miners back on the job.\\n\\n\"President Trump stressed that this isn\\'t about lowering standards for protecting health and safety, whether for miners or the public, but about ending unnecessary and costly regulations that kill jobs without producing any benefits. For many of us who were marginalized, ignored, or demonized for the past eight years, this is an occasion for real joy, celebration, and yes, vindication. We have a president who gets it — he really gets it,\" Mr. Bast concludes.\\n\\nSPICER-ISM\\n\\nThe daily White House press briefing is an interesting showcase. On Tuesday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about ongoing but unproven challenges to the Trump administration — \"you\\'ve got Russia, you\\'ve got wiretapping, there are investigations on Capitol Hill,\" one reporter noted.\\n\\n\"If the president puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that\\'s a Russian connection,\" Mr. Spicer responded, adding, \"I appreciate your agenda here.\"\\n\\nTHE SESSIONS ERA BEGINS\\n\\n\"The number of federal criminal prosecutions has declined for five consecutive years and is now at its lowest level in nearly two decades,\" writes John Gramlich, an analyst for the Pew Research Center who combed through new data from the federal courts. \"The decline comes as Attorney General Jeff Sessions has indicated that the Justice Department will reverse the trend and ramp up criminal prosecutions in the years ahead.\"\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2016, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against 77,152 defendants, a decline of 25 percent since 2011, when 102,617 defendants were charged, and the lowest yearly total in two decades. The data here count all defendants charged in U.S. district courts with felonies and serious misdemeanors, as well as some defendants charged with petty offenses. They exclude defendants whose cases were handled by magistrate judges.\\n\\n\"Prosecutions for drug, immigration and property offenses — the three most common categories of crime charged by the federal government — all have declined over the past five years,\" Mr. Gramlich says. \"The Justice Department filed drug charges against 24,638 defendants in 2016, down 23 percent from 2011. It filed immigration charges against 20,762 defendants, down 26 percent. And it charged 10,712 people with property offenses such as fraud and embezzlement, a 39 percent decline.\"\\n\\nThe analysts cite several factors for the trend, including then-Attorney General Eric Holder\\'s direction in 2013 to federal prosecutors to ensure their cases \"serve a substantial federal interest.\" Mr. Sessions, meanwhile, has pushed to increase prosecutions for drug- and gun-related offenses to reduce violent crime, which has risen nationally since 2015 according to the FBI — though such crime is \"far below the levels recorded in the 1990s,\" Mr. Gramlich says.\\n\\nFOXIFIED\\n\\nSuccess continues for Fox News Channel, which',\n",

Clark, at that time pastor of the Second United Presbyterian Church, in Allegheny, and a clergyman of nearly eleven years' standing, at the close of his services on Sabbath, the 5th.of August, requested those of his congregation who were willing to enlist in the national armies, to meet him in the basement of the church on the following Monday evening. Many came, and in three days' time three companies were organized, of one of which, Mr. Clark was elected Captain.\\n\\nDrill was immediately,commenced at the Allegheny Commons, and in a little time ten full companies had been recruited, and a regimental organization effected with the following field officers:\\n\\nJohn B. Clark, Colonel\\n\\nFrederick Gast, Lieutenant Colonel\\n\\nHugh Danver, Major\\n\\nOn the 29th of August the regiment, a thousand strong, proceeded to Harrisburg, arriving at Camp Curtin on the morning of the 21st, where it was armed and equipped, and on the evening of the same day started for Washington. Upon its arrival it crossed the Potomac, and went into camp at Camp Stanton. Drill was at once resumed, schools for the instrnction of ofhicers were established, and the command soon became proficient in duty, eliciting on parade the compliments of its superior officers by its fine soldierly bearing. It was assigned to the Second Brigade,1 Third Division, Fifth Corps.\\n\\nOn the 29th of August, at the opening of the Second Bull Run battle, the regiment was moved out in the direction of Bailey's Cross Roads, and formed in picket line, with orders to suffer no person to pass through in either direction. For a day and a half this order was rigidly executed. But as the battle raged and increased in violence on the plains of Manassas, the Union army was borne back, and the broken and dispirited troops came pouring in, until they could be no longer held, the confused mass breaking through and moving on towards Washington, whither the division was soon afterwards ordered to follow.\\n\\nAt the Capital, the regiment exchanged its arms, Austrian muskets, with which it had at first been supplied, for Springfield rifles. On the morning of the 14th of September, the command started on the march through Maryland, and arrived near Frederick at night-fall of the 16th. Here the division remained during the 17th, under orders to cover Frederick from the direction of Harper's Ferry. At sunset it received orders to move to Antietam, and at the moment of receiving the orders the sound of battle was heard for the first time that day. The command was again put upon the march, and for the entire night, up and down the rugged way it was urged forward and at a little after sunrise on the following morning, was halted on the Antietam battle-field, a short distance from Sharpsburg.\\n\\nA renewal of the battle was momentarily expected, and the men, though worn out by forced marches, stood ready for the onset. The ground was strewn with the unburied dead. Hour after hour it waited, but no sound of battle came. Finally, it having been ascertained that the enemy had withdrawn the brigade was ordered to Shepherdstown Ford, where it was saluted by a few shots from the enemy's artillery, from the opposite shore, but suffered no, loss. At night it retired a mile back from the river, where it went into bivouac, and while it remained in Maryland, was studiously drilled and disciplined.\\n\\nWith the army it crossed the Potomac, and marched up, the Loudon Valley to Warrenton, where M'Clellan was relieved and Burnside put in command. From Warrenton the regiment marched to a point on Potomac Creek, four miles from Fredericksburg, where it went into camp and was engaged in drill and picket duty until the 12th of December, when it marched to the music of cannon towards Fredericksburg.\\n\\nOn the following day the battle opened, and at three P.

       " 'A controversial Netflix series is prompting schools to warn parents about the risks of teen suicide.\\n\\n\"13 Reasons Why\" tells the fictional story of 17-year-old Hannah Baker, a troubled high school student who takes her own life. She leaves behind a series of audio tapes describing the \"13 reasons why\" she did it. The themes are graphic and intense, tackling not only suicide, but also sexual assault and underage drinking.\\n\\nNetflix\\n\\nNetflix says it\\'s intended for mature audiences because of explicit and disturbing content, and it aims to provide an opening to difficult conversations. But educators and parents are concerned that \"13 Reasons Why\" might be glamorizing teen suicide, reports CBS News\\' Tony Dokoupil.\\n\\nThe program\\'s portrayal of Hannah\\'s story has prompted school districts across the country to send warning letters to parents, saying \"the show may be perceived as glorifying and romanticizing suicide.\"\\n\\n\"Suicide is a tough issue to talk about,\" said Dr. Christina Conolly. She works for Maryland\\'s Montgomery County School District, where she helped write a letter which states \"adolescents watching without an adult ... could be at increased risk of self-harm.\"\\n\\n\"Watching a suicide or knowing someone who has died by suicide can lead others to completing a suicide themselves,\" Dr. Conolly explained.\\n\\nNetflix responded to the concerns in a statement, saying \"we gave the series a TV-MA rating, [and] added explicit warnings on the three most graphic episodes … we hope that \"13 Reasons Why\" can serve as a catalyst for conversation.\"\\n\\nRadio host Toby Knapp received a warning letter from his 13-year-old daughter Kyla\\'s school, but only after she had already watched the series alone. \"It\\'s caused her mom and I to say, \\'OK, what is our daughter watching, what is she spending her screen time on?\\'\"\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s all too real for most of the people my age to cope with and understand,\" Kyla said.\\n\\nMark Ralston / AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe series is designed to have an intense impact on viewers, according to executive producer Selena Gomez, who has struggled with depression herself. \"They have to see something that\\'s going to shake them. This show is as real as it can possibly get,\" Gomez said about the series.\\n\\n\\nIn other words, it\\'s meant to be a realistic show, which leads to real family dialogue.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad we\\'re having a lot of tough conversations, but I wish I had been tuned into those conversations sooner,\" Knapp said.\\n\\nThose conversations are extremely important to have — regardless of how they get started.

       " 'Most Americans who\\'ve followed the investigation into Hillary Clinton and her private email server fall into one of two camps. The first — those who believe the system is rigged and that she engaged in criminal acts but got away with them simply because her last name is Clinton. And the second — those who feel Hillary was the victim of yet another partisan witch-hunt that ended up being much ado about nothing, and that she\\'s being harassed simply because she\\'s a woman intent on breaking the highest \"glass ceiling\" of all.\\n\\nUndoubtedly congressional Republicans fall into the former group, so it was no surprise once the news broke that no criminal charges would be brought against Clinton that their first act would be to haul FBI Director James Comey in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to ask him for an explanation. Comey essentially argued that the applicable law — a 1917 statute based on \"gross negligence\" in mishandling classified information — wasn\\'t actually applicable.\\n\\n\"No reasonable prosecutor would bring the second case in 100 years focused on gross negligence,\" testified Comey, a former U.S. attorney. \"That\\'s just the way it is. I know the Department of Justice, [so] I know no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case.\" The case against Clinton, Comey added, did not meet the \"mens rea\" legal standard of criminal intent.\\n\\nYet one has to ask: What, then, was Hillary\\'s intent? Perhaps it wasn\\'t necessarily criminal intent, but there certainly was a lot of shady dealing going on between the Clinton Foundation, foreign leaders and others in the private loop with Hillary at the center. Even aside from the likelihood of hackers accessing the classified information on her private server, the reality that the Clintons used the secretary of state\\'s office to peddle influence and thereby enrich themselves is outrageous. The personal email setup likely helped her cover-up Benghazi, too.\\n\\nInstead, the whole affair is chalked up to \"carelessness.\" As Comey pointed out: \"I see evidence of great carelessness, but I do not see evidence that is sufficient to establish that Secretary Clinton or those with whom she was corresponding both talked about classified information on email and knew when they were doing it that it was against the law.\" While Comey claims no \"reasonable\" prosecutor would bring charges, it\\'s also true that one can indict a ham sandwich. Indeed, frivolous and politically motivated charges have often come from an overzealous prosecutor and a stacked grand jury bent on political mischief. (Former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy picks apart this defense from Comey by comparing it to a similar type of case where criminal negligence is often determined.)\\n\\nOr, taken the other way, how many who are accused of similar acts will now be using the \"Hillary defense\" to imply that they were only careless and had no criminal intent? One certainly could have lumped David Petraeus into that group had he been investigated post-Hillary.\\n\\nIt\\'s more difficult to sit there with a straight face and assure Americans that the system isn\\'t rigged, as Comey did, when two high-profile cases turn out so differently — to the benefit of the political party in power, no less. And when the top law-enforcement official in the country agrees to a secret meeting with the suspect\\'s former-president husband, Comey\\'s insistence that he \"did not coordinate … with anyone\" rings hollow.\\n\\nNo one in \"the White House, the Department of Justice, or anyone outside the FBI family had any idea what I was about to say,\" added Comey. \"I say that under oath, I stand by that. There was no coordination.\" We call bovine excrement on that: After all, why would Barack Obama be campaigning with Hillary on the very day she was cleared if he didn\\'t know the fix was in? (Does anyone think a sitting president would share a stage with a politician who\\'d just been indicted?)\\n\\nComey didn\\'t need to have a phone conversation with Attorney General Loretta Lynch or Obama or anyone else to know that Clinton was to be let off the hook. For one thing, Obama\\'s been tipping the scales of justice since last spring, claiming during a \"60 Minutes\" interview that Clinton\\'s malfeasance didn\\'t pose \"a national security problem.\" The FBI director is appointed by the president, and serves at the pleasure of the president. Comey knew the score.\\n\\nThere may be a second chance to give Hillary her due, though. In his opening remarks for the House hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), who chairs the Oversight Committee, asked Comey if the FBI investigation probed into Clinton\\'s congressional testimony and whether she lied under oath. When it was learned Comey had not and was waiting on a referral from Congress to do so, Chaffetz assured Comey he will get one. While the case could be a slam dunk on the factual side, the problem may be in proving intent there as well. Republicans don\\'t have a great record against Clinton perjury.\\n\\nIt will also be perceived, thanks to the mainstream media',\n",
       " 'Armed Agorism: A three part series about obtaining and owning firearms through the Grey Market by guest contributor Atreidies. If you would like more background on Agorism, Black and Grey markets check this video .The following information is for educational purposes only. Please follow the advice in the article at your own risk.\\n\\nBuying firearms is a potentially risky endeavor. If you are reading this article at the original source, you probably already understand that there is a defacto registration system in place on the federal level. This is not supposed to be the case, but most people wouldn\\'t doubt the inability of the federal government to let go of a voluntary data collection system that by law requires a purge after 24 hours, especially regarding something as potentially dangerous to their power structure as firearms in the hands of ordinary citizens.\\n\\nWhen buying from a federally licensed dealer (FFL), the purchaser fills out a form (4473) and the data collected on that form is either called in or entered electronically to check against a state or federal database, and the government decides if you can exercise your natural right to self-defense, or your enumerated and (supposedly) constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. The law requires that this data be purged every 24 hours, and the reality is that this is likely true. HOWEVER, it\\'s highly likely that the names and unique identifying information provided (SS Number, DOB, etc.) are added to a list of gun owners. There are ways to avoid having more \"hits\" on that list, or if you\\'ve never bought a gun through a licensed dealer, to never make it on the list in the first place.\\n\\nThe 4473\\'s are kept on file for 25 years or longer with the FFL, even if they go out of business. If the ATF or any other agency does a trace on a gun, they will go to the manufacturer, which will eventually lead them to the FFL that did the original sale and has the 4473 on file. If it is your name on the form, it is your door they will be knocking on. This is why private transfers are a great Grey Market solution, because they are essentially a dead end for the investigator.\\n\\nPrivate transfers happen between two individuals, without the FFL process. The seller can be an FFL selling from his private collection. Some states require private transactions to go through an FFL, so purchases in these states should be avoided. There are several avenues to find a seller, which I will discuss later. More importantly, there are some things to avoid when buying from private individuals.\\n\\nFirst, don\\'t use a social media account that is traceable to your real identity. Second, don\\'t provide your state of residence if you are buying out of state. Third, don\\'t mention that you are ineligible to possess a firearm if you are ineligible. It is a federal crime for an individual to KNOWINGLY sell to someone who resides out of state, or is ineligible. If you don\\'t tell them, they won\\'t know, and you aren\\'t causing them to run afoul of the law without their consent. Most won\\'t ask, and if they do, just drop all contact and move on. Giving false information can trap you in a setup. As a seller, if a buyer ever tells you they are from out of state or that they are ineligible, DO NOT SELL THEM THE FIREARM. This is potentially a setup, so just halt the transaction and walk. Maybe they\\'re just ignorant of the law, but you don\\'t want to take the chance.',\n",
       " 'A showdown between hunters and Canadian indigenous tribes in British Columbia (BC) is looming ahead of the upcoming grizzly bear hunting season. The tribes have announced they will be enforcing their own introduced ban on grizzly hunting on their territories along the BC north and central coasts, but hunters and hunting organizations say the ban is not legal and they will continue their grizzly hunts.\\n\\nIn 2012, The Coastal First Nations, a coalition of First Nations communities in British Columbia, proclaimed a grizzly bear hunt ban on their territory, regardless of the fact that it\\'s sanctioned by the British Columbian provincial government, which continues to distribute trophy-hunting permits.\\n\\nThe resource director at the Guardian Watchmen and chief of the Kitasoo/Xai\\'xais Nation, Doug Neasloss, said \"Coastal Guardian Watchmen\" will be patrolling their lands to enforce the ban by telling hunters to stop and by scaring their prey away.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been brought up to have respect for these animals and it\\'s really unfortunate when people just come here and shoot these animals for sport. We like business to come to our territory, but there\\'s some industries that are not accepted and not welcome, and trophy hunting is one of them.\" said Neasloss\\n\\nWhen grizzlies are trophy hunted, their heads are normally cut off, the body skinned and whatever of the carcass meat the hunters don\\'t want is usually left behind.\\n\\nA BC provincial government spokesman said 300 grizzly bears in BC are killed each year in regulated hunts and that there are 15,000 grizzlies in the province - a figure disputed by conservation and animal rights groups. Canada\\'s Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada says grizzlies are \"a special concern\" as they are \"particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events\".\\n\\nAlberta banned grizzly hunting in 2006, declaring the bear a threatened species.\\n\\nAlthough Neasloss said the First Nations\\' ban has reduced the number of grizzlies hunted each year and that many hunters have turned in their permits out of respect, experts say it is \"unlikely the big business of bear hunting\" will end anytime soon.\\n\\nOne company, Covert Outfitting, offers grizzly hunting excursions for $19,000. According to a Covert Outfitting spokesman, the number of grizzlies they hunt stays within limits set by the Government to sustain the bear population.\\n\\n\"Why do we personify an animal because it has a name and people take pictures of it?\" said the spokesman \"With grizzly bears, it\\'s because they\\'re beautiful and people think they\\'re amazing, but if they were ugly and had no hair and killed people every day, everyone would want us to shoot them.\"\\n\\nHe added \"A lot of people think it\\'s total insanity, but it\\'s not. Maybe it\\'s insanity living in the top of a skyscraper in downtown Vancouver, and having no idea what nature is or where our food comes from.\"\\n\\nHowever, Neasloss is confident they will win their fight for a ban on grizzly hunting, as he believes most British Columbians are against trophy hunting.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very hopeful that we\\'re going to stop it. And I think the province needs to listen to us, to start listening to the people,\" he said.',\n",

       " \"In the fall of 2008, Brooke and I, newly parents of our second daughter, floated a dream that one day we would take month-long vacations. First, we wanted to be able to really experience a location, have enough time to visit all the sites. Second, we had recently returned from a week-long Disney Cruise and I observed that around day 5 or so, you start to notice this enveloping feeling of euphoria, a deeper stage of vacation relaxation; where you are comfortable enough with your surroundings that your mind no longer has to focus as much effort on learning and adapting, but instead can focus solely on enjoyment and time spent together as a family. At this stage, your trappings at home, work related stress and other concerns have been muted. Maybe some of these feelings were purposefully implanted by Disney, but in any case, I felt that there is more to gain from longer vacations and tapping into this emotional stage. Third, we love to travel and being able to do it for month would be fantastic. Fourth, we know that children that travel more are smarter, more socially aware, accepting and more easily adaptable. Now, we were faced with four major hurdles in order to accomplish this.\\n\\nHow do we afford such trips? How do we arrange for our kids to go on trips like this with us? How do I collect enough vacation time to take a month off? What do we do with our dog?\\n\\nOne of the biggest hurdles was the cost, but with some planning and scrimping, we were getting close, but it was taking a long time. Just after our 10 year wedding anniversary, I decided to upgrade Brooke's rings and she helped pick out her dream set. After having it resized and then trying it on, however, she decided that she would rather spend that money on our California trip and create family memories than to have a material possession such as this when she liked her current rings well enough. We eventually worked out the other hurdles and in 2015 began making travel plans and reservations for our first month-long trip, a road trip in California! The dates of the trip shifted slightly throughout planning and the direction in which we were traveling (we changed from South to North to North to South), but the winter and spring of 2016 had us heavily into travel planning and other arrangements. Finally, on June 21, 2016, we arrived at the Tampa Airport (TPA) and flew out to San Francisco (SFO) by way of Saint Louis (STL) on Southwest Airlines. Our trip began and I began to document our experience for our future enjoyment.\\n\\nA big thank you is due to my cousin and best friend, Graham, who house and pet sitted while we were gone and this trip would not have been possible if he had not volunteered to do so.\\n\\nWhen we returned, family and friends also asked for details of our experience and I shifted that documentation online through simple pictures and eventually that evolved to this blog.

Half-Life 2, DOOM 3, Sims 2, Knights of the Old Republic II. Sure, they all look great, but we still like being a little surprised, and seeing something new at the big show. Thankfully, BioWare delivered today with an RPG that, although familiar, is something completely new at the same time.\\n\\nAlthough BioWare is probably best known for their Dungeons and Dragon\\'s based Baldur\\'s Gate series, Dragon Age isn\\'t another foray into the D&D universe. As Joint-CEO Ray Muzyka told us, \"Dragon Age is the spiritual successor to Baldur\\'s Gate.\" However, Dragon Age has nothing to do directly with Baldur\\'s Gate.\\n\\nAlthough set against a traditional fantasy backdrop, BioWare is hoping to do something a little different with Dragon Age, and the world won\\'t be inhabited by Dwarves, Elves and Halflings -- although it will be filled with Dwarf-like, Elf-like and Halfling-like races. While this may sound like a cop-out, Ray explained that BioWare wanted to try something a little different, but still wanted it to be familiar to fantasy RPG players. Although nothing is finalized at this point, Dragon Age will feature archetypal races and classes (you know, fighters, clerics, mages and the like), and BioWare is looking to the community to decide exactly which classes and races they want to see in the game. We did see one completely new race that will be in the game, though. Although they don\\'t have a name as of yet, or at least BioWare wasn\\'t saying what the name was, the characters sport horns on their heads and look rather lizard (or perhaps dragon) like.\\n\\nBioWare is known for their intensive research when building universes, and as with all their RPGs, BioWare strives to create an extremely deep and rich lore to go with their worlds. Dragon Age will be no exception, and they have already developed a backstory and culture for the playable races as well as the non-playable races in the game. BioWare even has a few linguistics PhD students developing entirely new languages for Dragon Age. When asked about the significance of the title, BioWare told us that, like the Stone Age and Iron Age, they wanted to indicate that the game takes place in a time where dragons are prevalent.\\n\\nLike most RPGs, in the beginning you\\'ll create a party of characters and tailor them to your desire. You\\'ll also be able to hire henchmen during the game, and BioWare promises you\\'ll run into some characters with a lot of personality, like Minsc from Baldur\\'s Gate.',\n",

I like handling all of the issues that bother me in order to go through life truly happy. There\\'s a lot of people out there with ghosts, a lot of demons haunting their mind. In my opinion, this is your chance to face it head on and try to come up with a better path.\"\\n\\nBut a fear of facing oneself shouldn\\'t be a deterrent to any type of therapy. Sensory deprivation has become a popular exercise throughout the world, with validated positive results that extend into everyday life. Namely stress and anxiety reduction, but also as an adjunct for chronic physical pain.\\n\\nDr. Darren Weissman, a holistic physician who has floated weekly since 1986, explains, \"I really feel that it\\'s a result of floating and getting myself out of the way that I saw how all these multiple disciplines that activate the healing potentials of the body actually work together.\"\\n\\nFloating isn\\'t just about facing the negative aspects of life. It\\'s also about being more aware of, and appreciating the good. Letting the little, good moments simmer -- instead of just moving to the next thing -- helps them feel (and actually become) more real.\\n\\nAs Dr. Weissman says, it \"allows us to recognize our body\\'s potentials. It opens us to a whole different level of awareness and of who we are. We start to notice things. It awakens consciousness.\"\\n\\nMatt Frederickson, an avid user of floatation tanks, says, \"Since I started doing it, I\\'ve become more calm, especially in my work life.\" A long-time sufferer of chronic neck, head, and back pain, Frederickson took his first float after hearing Joe Rogan\\'s praise of the physical benefits of the isolation tank on Marc Maron\\'s WTF podcast. \"I thought it sounded interesting because I personally suffer from a lot of chronic pain, so that\\'s what initially drew me to it.\"\\n\\nFrederickson tried therapies for his chronic pain, a lot of which worked a little, but he\\'s found that no other practice produces results as consistently effective as the isolation tank. But, like Rogan, he gets more out of it than he initially sought. \"I still use it mainly for the pain,\" he says. \"It really helps lessen that, but I think the secondary benefit, for me, would be the anxiety that\\'s tied to the pain.\"',\n",

For over a thousand years the sword was revered as the very soul of the samurai warriors who wielded it, commanding awe, respect, and an almost religious devotion. The tumultuous events of modern Japanese history and the nation\\'s relentless drive toward technological advancement, however, irrevocably sealed the sword\\'s fate, and, along with the samurai class, the sword became an anachronism, both culturally and militarily.\\n\\n\\nAs Japan entered a period of unprecedented Imperial expansion in the early twentieth century, the Japanese sword, despite its limited practical effect, became a feature of the soldier\\'s arsenal-an echo of the mythical status it enjoyed in feudal times. The Yasukuni swords emerged during the build-up to World War II, in part to help meet the huge demands of the Imperial Army, but more importantly out of a desire to preserve time-honored forging methods, and to revive the spirit of the samurai. For these reasons, they were notably distinct from so-called \"Showa-to,\" which were mass-produced and inferior in quality and artistry.\\n\\n\\nAll swords were banned in the immediate aftermath of World War II, and the decades that followed have seen a decline in the popularity of Yasukuni swords, largely because of their associations with that war and the military. Another factor has been the stigma attached to Showa-to, which has helped to stereotype wartime swords in general.\\n\\n\\nRecent years, however, have seen a renewed interest in the surviving Yasukuni swords. Many collectors and appraisers have acknowledged the workmanship of these swords as displaying a perfect blend of technology and tradition, and a quality that can rival even that of the great classical smiths.\\n\\n\\nIn his tribute to the Yasukuni smiths, acclaimed photographer and sword enthusiast Tom Kishida has compiled an extensive study of these rare and exceptional swords, drawing on a variety of sources to shed light on this often little-understood chapter of Japanese sword history. With his unique eye for capturing the beauty of the blades in his photographs, he has provided the reader with the most lavishly detailed book on Yasukuni swords to date. This will be an important addition to the libraries of specialists and connoisseurs, and to those who wish to deepen their understanding of these fascinating wartime weapons.

       " 'Curtis Granderson, bottom, and Justin Verlander were big-time contributors for the Tigers during Detroit\\'s run to the 2006 World Series. (Photo: Otto Greule Jr, Getty Images)\\n\\nIn a postseason that began with more than a dozen former Tigers in the mix for a World Series ring, three still are standing.\\n\\nAnd two just happen to be among the best Tigers\\' draft picks of not just recent history, but all-time.\\n\\nJustin Verlander, the new ace of the Astros, and Curtis Granderson, an outfielder for the Dodgers, each will play in their third World Series when things get started Tuesday night — and each will be searching for their first World Series ring.\\n\\n\"No, no,\" Tigers general manager Al Avila said this week, when asked about his rooting interest — though it\\'s worth noting, his father, Ralph, remains a consultant for the Dodgers, as does Tommy Lasorda, the godfather of Alex Avila. But his relationship with Verlander is deep, too. \"What I usually like in these series is that it goes seven and it\\'s really exciting.\"\\n\\nHouston also has another former Tigers celebrated draft pick, outfielder Cameron Maybin, who had two stints in Detroit. But few Tigers have been celebrated by fans over the past dozen years like Granderson, a third-round draft pick out of the University of Illinois-Chicago in 2002, and Verlander, the No. 2 overall pick out of Old Dominion University in 2004.\\n\\nMore: Henning: Tigers seek bullpen relief down on the farm\\n\\nBy 2006, both were full-time, big-time contributors in Detroit, Granderson as the starting center fielder and Verlander as the ace of the staff, as the Tigers stunned baseball and — three years after losing an American League-record 119 games — made it all the way to the World Series.\\n\\nThat year not only marked the beginning of Tigers baseball renaissance, but also the start of two promising careers, one which should land Verlander, someday, in Baseball\\'s Hall of Fame, and another which should at least get Granderson some consideration, depending on how much longer he plays.\\n\\nVerlander\\'s 56.6 career WAR (Wins Above Replacement), per BaseballReference.com, is fourth-best ever among a player drafted and subsequently signed by the Tigers, while Granderson\\'s 45.8 is fifth-best.\\n\\nThey are easily the two biggest draft successes in the Dave Dombrowski/Al Avila tenure, which began in November 2001. Nobody else comes close.\\n\\nIn the history of Tigers drafts — we\\'re counting only June drafts here, not the now-defunct January draft — only Lou Whitaker (74.9, fifth round, 1975), Alan Trammell (70.4, second, 1976) and John Smoltz (69.5, 22nd, 1985) have gone one to accumulate higher career WARs than Verlander and Granderson.\\n\\nAnd Verlander, 34, is not anywhere close to being done adding to his career WAR, as he\\'s shown in his nine-game run with the Astros. And Granderson, 36, probably isn\\'t either, though he has struggled mightily in the couple of months since joining the Dodgers — so much so that he was left off the World Series roster, when the Dodgers announced their final 25 on Tuesday afternoon.\\n\\nMore: Dodgers leave slumping Granderson off World Series roster\\n\\nJustin Verlander is 4-0 with a 1.46 ERA and 24 strikeouts in 24.2 innings this postseason with the Houston Astros. (Photo: David J. Phillip, Associated Press)\\n\\nNO. 1 WITH A BULLET\\n\\nThe Tigers\\' first two first-round draft picks under the Dave Dombrowski-Avila era were total disasters. In 2002, Detroit selected a high-school shortstop from California named Scott Moore. In 2003, the Tigers took Wake Forest right-hander Kyle Sleeth. The two would combine to play 152 games in the major leagues, all by Moore, and none with the Tigers.\\n\\nWhen June 2004 rolled around, though, they were certain they had the man that could alter the franchise\\'s fortunes. Other teams might have liked this guy or that guy. Verlander was no consensus. But the Tigers were all in on the lanky right-hander — and even better for them, they got word the Padres, with the No. 1 overall pick, planned to take a high-school infielder named Matt Bush with the No. 1 overall pick.\\n\\n\"I can tell you one thing,\" said Avila, \"Verlander was the guy we wanted.\"\\n\\nMore: Avila defends analytics department: \\'We went from nothing\\'\\n\\nBush\\'s story is well-documented.

Learning that chickens are smarter than most people think, and that they can be trained, promotes much more positive attitudes towards the birds.\\n\\nThe research, published in the journal Animals, demonstrates a way of promoting more positive attitudes to animals. Through \\'clicker training\\' chickens, students also learnt to train animals using \\'force free\\' methods (encouragement rather than coercion) ─ important in future careers working closely with animals.\\n\\nThe study, with first-year School of Animal and Veterinary Science students at the University\\'s Roseworthy campus, investigated the attitudes of the students before and after they had practical classes clicker-training chickens.\\n\\n\"We showed that attitudes to animals are linked to how clever we think that they are,\" says lead author Dr Susan Hazel, Senior Lecturer in Animal Behaviour in the School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences.\\n\\n\"When students learnt to clicker train the chickens ─ who pick up colour discrimination incredibly quickly ─ they were more likely to think that chickens are intelligent than before the class. The students were also more likely to think chickens can experience boredom, frustration and happiness.\\n\\n\"It was also a very effective class for teaching students the basics of animal training, and a number of students have told me afterwards how they have used that information in training their own animals.\"\\n\\nThe students paired clickers with food, so the chickens learnt the click meant they have done what was wanted and would be rewarded.\\n\\nThe students\\' first task was to get the chickens to peck on a red target. This behaviour was \\'shaped\\', meaning initially the chicken was clicked and rewarded immediately with food when it looked at the target. Progressively rewards were only given when the chicken got closer, and closer, until it actually pecked the target. Chickens soon learnt colour discrimination. They learnt to peck on the red target, rather than green or yellow.\\n\\n\"Animals learn all of the time, even when we are not deliberately training them,\" says Dr Hazel. \"Understanding how they learn is integral to being able to manage or train animals effectively.\\n\\n\"Chickens are descendants of wild jungle fowl, and to survive had to learn quickly what food was good to peck at and what they should ignore.

       " 'As it evolved, somatization became a way to think about and classify unexplained symptoms. The word somatization fell out of favor because it always implied psychogenicity. It was an hypothesis that was often inconsistent with observed data, and was mired in different schools of psychiatric thought and argument. For better or worse, it lacked face validity to many physicians. Still, it stayed around because it described common symptoms and situations that didn\\'t fit in otherwise and which, at some level, made at least a little sense. In a previous post, John Quinter writes disparagingly of somatization: It \\'in fact only reflects the medical observer\\'s \"psychologization\" of the clinical problem.\\' John\\'s comment exposes the opposition to somatization and a psychosocial basis for fibromyalgia. Dan Clauw, together with a group of truly expert co-authors, writes\\n\\nIn the final analysis, physical versus psychologic distinctions regarding unexplained symptoms might rest on preconception and perspective rather than a priori hypothesis testing. Historically, observers of syndromes of unexplained symptoms have often drawn differing conclusions from like presentations. Whereas some observers have preferred to see a common physiological mechanism that explains symptoms, others have postulated common psychologic traumas ranging from childhood abuse to current stressors. Still others have invoked the tendency for some individuals to seek relief from social predicaments and for some clinicians and scientists to derive novel illnesses that accommodate them.1\\n\\nBeginning at the end of the 20th, a clearer recognition of the limitations of the somatization concept was acknowledged. Sharpe wrote in 2006 \\'The assumptions that (a) bodily pathology can always explain bodily symptoms, (b) psychopathology can always explain bodily symptoms in the absence of bodily pathology, and (c) dichotomizing bodily symptoms into biomedical and psychiatric types is clinically useful were all found to have questionable validity and utility.2 He wrote further that \\'Alternative multiaxial diagnostic approaches for the classification of bodily symptoms are proposed. These are intended to (a) give greater prominence to bodily symptoms in their own right, (b) allow etiology to be conceptualized in terms of multiple factors, and (c) provide the basis for integrating medical and psychiatric approaches to patient care.\\n\\nSuch ideas are also found in the designation of illnesses like fibromyalgia and similar disorders as `somatic syndromes disorders,\\' \\'physical symptom disorders,\\' \\'functional symptoms disorders,\\' \\'somatic and multisomatic symptom disorders.\\' It became clear that the line between psychiatric conditions and physical ones was difficult to draw, and as Sharpe said, etiology should be to be \\'conceptualized in terms of multiple factors.\\'\\n\\n\\'Somatization\\' was also confounded by the specialties that invoked it. The psychiatrists clearly had in mind a psychiatric disorder—the type of illness that I never saw in my patients with fibromyalgia. The primary care physician input, led by the careful, thoughtful and ultimately very helpful work of Kurt Kroenke and others in his group, noted that somatic symptoms were ubiquitous and mostly transitory. Rheumatologists saw a different pattern in chronic pain patients: persistent increased numbers of somatic symptoms and symptom severity.\\n\\nKroenke developed as series of Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ) that identified those with many somatic symptoms, and he couched descriptive language in non-psychiatric terms. In 1997 he wrote, \\'For clinical or research use in primary care, the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for somatization disorder are too restrictive, while the criteria for un- differentiated somatoform disorder are overly inclusive. In this article, we examine the validity of multisomatoform disorder, defined as 3 or more medically unexplained, currently bothersome physical symptoms plus a long (≥2 years) history of somatization.\\'3 In 2012, he developed an 8-item question that could be used together with the (disputed) DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder. The items included GI-GU problems, back pain, joint and muscle pain, headaches, chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, trouble sleeping. It is a veritable checklist for fibromyalgia, but is neutral as to psychogenicity—as was the multisomatoform disorder.\\n\\nWithout intending it, the 2010 ACR fibromyalgia made clear the prominence of somatic symptoms in fibromyalgia. Given multiple painful regions, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia is dependent on somatic symptoms. Maybe, as some have suggested, fibromyalgia should be considered as a kind of somatic pain disorder. Noll-Hussong in 2011 used the term, \\'Pain-predominant multisomatoform disorder.\\'4 Not a bad phrase for fibromyalgia, to my mind.\\n\\nCollecting data on the number (or the number and severity) of somatic symptoms provides insights into fibromyalgia. Symptoms increase with age; people with fibromyalgia report many more symptoms than non-fib',\n",

       " 'It\\'s a delightful story I\\'ve heard dozens of times, and retold a few times myself: Abraham Lincoln faced with some thorny issue that could be settled by a twist of language, or a slight abuse of power, asks his questioner how many legs would a dog have, if we called the dog\\'s tail, a leg. \"Five,\" the questioner responds confident in his mathematical ability to do simple addition.\\n\\n\"No,\" Lincoln says. \"Calling a dog\\'s tail a leg, doesn\\'t make it a leg.\"\\n\\nBut there is always the doubt: Is the story accurate? Is this just another of the dozens of quotes that are misattributed to Lincoln in order to lend credence to them?\\n\\nI have a source for the quote: Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln by distinguished men of his time / collected and edited by Allen Thorndike Rice (1853-1889). New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1909. This story is found on page 242. Remarkably, the book is still available in an edition from the University of Michigan Press. More convenient for us, the University of Michigan has the entire text on-line, in the Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, an on-line source whose whole text is searchable.\\n\\nHowever, Lincoln does not tell the story about a dog — he uses a calf.\\n\\nRice\\'s book is a collection of reminiscences of others, exactly as the title suggests. Among those doing the reminiscing are ex-president and Gen. U. S. Grant, Massachusetts Gov. Benjamin Butler (also a former Member of Congress), Charles A. Dana the editor and former Assistant Secretary of War, and several others. In describing Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation, George W. Julian relates the story. Julian was a Free-Soil Party leader and a Member of Congress during Lincoln\\'s administration. Julian\\'s story begins on page 241:\\n\\nFew subjects have been more debated and less understood than the Proclamation of Emancipation. Mr. Lincoln was himself opposed to the measure, and when he very reluctantly issued the preliminary proclamation in September, 1862, he wished it distinctly understood that the deportation of the slaves was, in his mind, inseparably connected with the policy. Like Mr. Clay and other prominent leaders of the old Whig party, he believed in colonization, and that the separation of the two races was necessary to the welfare of both. He was at that time pressing upon the attention of Congress a scheme of colonization in Chiriqui, in Central America, which Senator Pomeroy espoused with great zeal, and in which he had the favor of a majority of the Cabinet, including Secretary Smith, who warmly indorsed the project. Subsequent developments, however, proved that it was simply an organization for land-stealing and plunder, and it was abandoned; but it is by no means certain that if the President had foreseen this fact his preliminary notice to the rebels would have been given. There are strong reasons for saying that he doubted his right to emancipate under the war power, and he doubtless meant what he said when he compared an Executive order to that effect to \"the Pope\\'s Bull against the comet.\" In discussing the question, he used to liken the case to that of the boy who, when asked how many legs his calf would have if he called its tail a leg, replied, \" Five,\" to which the prompt response was made that calling the tail a leg would not make it a leg.\\n\\nI believe it is fair to call the story \"confirmed.\" It\\'s not an exact quote, but it\\'s an accurate story.\\n\\nPlease share:\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

       " 'Consider the paddy wagon. From the mid-19th century through the mid-20th, this was the common term for the vehicles in which police hauled convicts and arrestees to jails, courts and prisons. Consider, now, the origin of the term. The \"paddies\" were Irish immigrants, who were flocking to the United States in the 1840s and \\'50s, fleeing the great famine that had descended on Ireland. And the Irish, some right-thinking Protestant Americans believed, were inherently a criminal bunch.\\n\\nIn the 1840s and \\'50s, there were enough of those right-thinking Americans to form a political party: the American Party, they called it, though (because when asked about their doings, many apparently paranoid members responded, \"I know nothing\") it soon came to be known as the Know Nothings. With Irish and German immigrants flooding into the country (the Germans largely fleeing the repression that followed the failed revolutions of 1848), the Know Nothings experienced a brief surge of popularity until the far greater conflict between slave states and free states led to a more fundamental reshuffling of political parties. Some Know Nothings drifted into the ranks of the newly formed Republican Party. One early GOP leader, Abraham Lincoln, did everything he could to squelch their influence and make clear that German, Irish and all other immigrants were welcome additions to the party and the nation.\\n\\nLike most immigrant groups, the Irish took the hardest, most thankless jobs — building railroads, for instance. Nonetheless, the nativist leaders of the time — the 1850s version of Fox News chief Roger Ailes — insisted that guys with names like Hannity and O\\'Reilly were inherently disposed to crime and violence, undeterred by the absence of data that backed up their claims.\\n\\n\\'Twas ever thus. Italians were criminals or anarchists; Jews were criminals (as in \"The Great Gatsby\") or communists; Mexicans, if you believe Donald Trump, are rapists and murderers. Never mind, as a recent voluminous study by the National Academy of Sciences makes clear, that the linkage between immigrants and crime is not merely fictitious but actually inverse: After close statistical analysis, the study concludes, \"Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates.\" Based on the findings of at least 30 academic papers, the study concludes that foreign-born young men have an incarceration rate that is one-fourth that of native-born, and that \"neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have lower rates of crime and violence\" than other socioeconomically equivalent neighborhoods.\\n\\nIndeed, the growing number of the foreign-born over the past quarter-century goes a long way to explaining the huge drop in crime and violence that the nation has experienced during that time. The number of murders in New York City dropped from 2,245 in 1990 to 328 last year; in Los Angeles County it fell from 1,944 in 1993 to 551 last year, even as the number and share of their foreign-born residents skyrocketed. Nationally, in 2014 violent crime rates were at their lowest level in 20 years, according to the FBI.\\n\\nThe immigrant crime wave that right-wing media and many Republican politicians rail about, then, is either a figment of their imaginations or an article of faith that, whatever their individual beliefs, they seek to instill or inflame in their followers. These beliefs are as valid as their predecessors\\' claims that the Irish or the Chinese, say, posed a danger to the United States and that no more of them should be allowed in. They are in the grand tradition of Madison Grant\\'s hugely influential 1916 book \"The Passing of the Great Race,\" which argued that the \"Nordics\" of Northwestern Europe were a superior race to Southern and Eastern Europeans (Italians, Jews, Greeks et al.), and that immigration from anyplace other than Northwest Europe should be banned. In 1924, Congress did just that, enacting a law that effectively restricted immigration from all but the \"Nordic\" nations, a law that stayed on the books until the Great Society Congress of 1965 repealed it.\\n\\nSo to those who want to repeal birthright citizenship and send those dangerous Mexicans back to their homeland: Why stop there? Donald Trump\\'s claims about the dangers posed by Mexicans are no more valid than Madison Grant\\'s about the Italian and Jewish menace, or the Know Nothings\\' about the criminal tendencies of the Irish.

       " \"Abstract\\n\\nBackground: Previous studies have demonstrated that methamphetamine abuse leads to memory deficits and these are associated with relapse. Furthermore, extensive evidence indicates that nicotine prevents and/or improves memory deficits in different models of cognitive dysfunction and these nicotinic effects might be mediated by hippocampal or cortical nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The present study investigated whether nicotine attenuates methamphetamine-induced novel object recognition deficits in rats and explored potential underlying mechanisms. Methods: Adolescent or adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received either nicotine water (10–75 μg/mL) or tap water for several weeks. Methamphetamine (4×7.5mg/kg/injection) or saline was administered either before or after chronic nicotine exposure. Novel object recognition was evaluated 6 days after methamphetamine or saline. Serotonin transporter function and density and α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density were assessed on the following day. Results: Chronic nicotine intake via drinking water beginning during either adolescence or adulthood attenuated the novel object recognition deficits caused by a high-dose methamphetamine administration. Similarly, nicotine attenuated methamphetamine-induced deficits in novel object recognition when administered after methamphetamine treatment. However, nicotine did not attenuate the serotonergic deficits caused by methamphetamine in adults. Conversely, nicotine attenuated methamphetamine-induced deficits in α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in the hippocampal CA1 region. Furthermore, nicotine increased α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in the hippocampal CA3, dentate gyrus and perirhinal cortex in both saline- and methamphetamine-treated rats. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest that nicotine-induced increases in α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex might be one mechanism by which novel object recognition deficits are attenuated by nicotine in methamphetamine-treated rats.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nMethamphetamine (METH) abuse is a significant public health problem with annual prevalence rate of abuse in 2013 in >1% of adolescents and young adults (Johnston et al., 2014). Extensive clinical evidence indicates that METH abuse causes significant neurocognitive deficits (Kalechstein et al., 2003, 2009; Gonzalez et al., 2004; Hoffman et al., 2006; Cherner et al., 2010; Casaletto et al., 2014). For example, episodic memory is reduced among participants with a history of METH abuse (approximately 11 years), as assessed by performance in learning and recall tests (Casaletto et al., 2014). METH users also present with deficits in learning, motor ability, and working memory tests (Cherner et al., 2010). Neurocognitive deficits occur not only in individuals currently using METH (Simon et al., 2000) but can also persist long after METH is discontinued (4 days to 7 months) (Kalechstein et al., 2003, 2009; Gonzalez et al., 2004; Hoffman et al., 2006; Cherner et al., 2010; Casaletto et al., 2014). Among the different types of neurocognitive deficits caused by METH abuse, METH-associated neurocognitive deficits are greater for episodic memory, executive functions, information processing speed, and motor skills and lesser for attention, working memory, and verbal fluency (Scott et al., 2007). Notably, relapse is associated with episodic memory deficits but not other types of cognitive dysfunction among METH abusers (Simon et al., 2004).\\n\\nIn addition to its impact on cognition, METH abuse causes brain abnormalities in areas important for memory, such as the hippocampus and cortex. For example, Thompson et al. (2004) reported that METH abusers have 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects as assessed by MRI, and these deficits correlated with deficits in deficits on a word recall task. The integrity of hippocampal and cortical neurons can also be assessed by the binding of the serotonin transporter (SERT), a marker highly expressed in these neuronal regions (Lawrence et al., 1993; for review, see Meneses et al., 2011). Loss of presynaptic serotonergic markers such as SERT indicates loss of this population of presynaptic serotonergic terminals. Studies have reported significant loss of serotonergic markers in the hippocampus and cortex of individuals with cognitive dysfunction, such as in METH abuse or Alzheimer's disease (Chen et al., 1996; Sekine et al., 2006; Ouchi et al., 2009). For example, positron emission tomography scan revealed that SERT densities are reduced in several brain regions of abstinent METH abusers (Sekine et al., 2006).\\n\\nNovel object recognition (NOR) is an established preclinical model for evaluating recognition memory deficits (for review, see Kinnavane et al., 2014). This test relies on the instinct of rats to preferentially explore novel objects over familiar objects, thus requiring the animals to remember which object is familiar. The perir\",\n",

For the past several years, chroniclers of the relationship between the president and Republicans in Congress have searched in vain for new ways to describe chaos. When chaos wasn\\'t on order, the task was to find new ways to connote stasis—the lack of progress that filled the exhausted interregnum between periods of chaos.\\n\\nJohn Dickerson John Dickerson is a co-anchor of CBS This Morning, co-host of the Slate Political Gabfest, host of the Whistlestop podcast, and author of Whistlestop and On Her Trail.\\n\\nNow the job has changed a bit. Crisis budgeting that led to tense moments is largely gone, mostly because House Republicans have decided not to stage confrontations. That is healthy, but there seems to have been a collective decision that like the convalescent, no politician is going to risk tearing the stitches by doing much more than padding around the ward. No one is going to do anything big or risky. The pace of action is neither chaotic nor energetic but just shy of slipping on a Snuggie and settling in for a Lord of the Rings marathon.\\n\\nThis is, of course, pathetic. Republicans and Democrats are both so frightened about creating fights within their own parties during an election year that they are leaving the big questions unanswered. Today, House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp put forward a set of fundamental tax reform proposals. It was the product of years of work between Camp, a Republican, and his Democratic counterpart in the Senate, Max Baucus. The two traveled across the country holding hearings, taking in mountains of input, and engaging in all the other kinds of activity that most people like to think of when they think of elected representatives doing their jobs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAll that work is going nowhere. No one in either party wants to risk taking on the complicated and tricky issue that might offend big contributors or stir up voters in the wrong way. There will continue to be talk on both sides, but no one is going to get anything done. Budget expert Stan Collender thinks that means no action on this issue until 2019.\\n\\nThe pace of action in Washington is just shy of slipping on a Snuggie and settling in for a Lord of the Rings marathon.\\n\\nTrade and immigration are two other items that have gone from the back burner to the freezer. House Speaker John Boehner won\\'t start a fight in his party by bringing up immigration reform, and President Obama won\\'t force his party to take up trade legislation that the president says will help the economy.\\n\\nThe stakes are so low in Washington that Obama and Boehner could even sit down and meet again after a long pause. Tuesday, the two men talked for an hour in what was their longest noncrisis conversation in years. Boehner emerged calling it a \"nice meeting\" and then went back to beating up on the president and his health care law.\\n\\nSo if nothing is going to get done, what did they talk about? Well, just because no one in Washington is going to do anything big or meaningful doesn\\'t mean they have totally banished their chance to do a little something.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nThere is a possibility that the appropriations process will actually take place in some form this year. Spending items may actually be considered by a committee in which people will have their say about the merits of each program. Although the big budget questions of our time—big new spending or entitlement reforms—are still out of the conversation, at least spending levels won\\'t be determined by sequestration. There\\'s also a slim chance that Congress might work together on the transportation bill, flood insurance, and a water resource bill in the way that members worked together to pass the farm bill.\\n\\nThose are not grand pieces of legislation, but they are what one top congressional aide calls the \"meat and potatoes\" of operating a government. A cynic might also call them the least lawmakers can be expected to do and still deserve the name. Of course, even limited progress is the optimistic view. Though the temperature has lowered and chaos is on pause, it\\'s still possible that lawmakers could slip from risk-free coasting to a full-on coma. Given how few legislative days are scheduled for this election year, it may be impossible even to handle the meat-and-potato basics.

The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Health and Human Services announced on April 22, 2014 that they had imposed nearly $2 million in penalties on two entities as a result of the theft of unencrypted laptops.\\n\\nAs previously noted in this blog, theft or loss of laptops or other portable electronic devices remains a predominant factor in HIPAA breaches, constituting 57.5% of the approximately 400 List Breaches that involved reported theft or loss as of August 2013.\\n\\nIn the first incident, Concentra Health Services was fined $1,725,220 and agreed to adopt a corrective action plan after an OCR investigation following a report of the theft of an unencrypted laptop from a physical therapy clinic. According to the press release,\\n\\n\"OCR\\'s investigation revealed Concentra had previously recognized in multiple risk analyses that a lack of encryption on its laptops, desktop computers, medical equipment, tablets and other devices containing electronic protected health information (ePHI) was a critical risk. While steps were taken to begin encryption, Concentra\\'s efforts were incomplete and inconsistent over time leaving patient PHI vulnerable throughout the organization. OCR\\'s investigation further found Concentra had insufficient security management processes in place to safeguard patient information.\"\\n\\nThis isn\\'t Concentra\\'s first experience with laptop theft. The OCR list of Breaches Affecting 500 or More Individuals (also known as the \"Wall of Shame\") includes two prior similar incidents, one in 2009 and another in 2011. (It is unclear whether this theft was related to the 2011 incident). Modern Healthcare reports that Concentra reported 16 additional breaches involving fewer than 500 individuals\\' records. So, although 434 out of 597 laptops had been encrypted according to HealthITSecurity.com, a batting average of .726 wasn\\'t good enough given their status as repeat offenders. Concentra\\'s resolution agreement, including the Corrective Action Plan, is available here and is worth reading. Among other conditions, OCR requires that the company provide an update regarding its encryption status, including the percentage of all Concentra devices and equipment (laptops, desktops, medical equipment, tablets, and other storage devices) that are encrypted and an explanation for the percentage of devices and equipment that are not encrypted.\\n\\nThe company\\'s incomplete and inadequate implementation of compliance steps after known vulnerabilities had been identified may also have contributed to the severity of the penalty. One of the worst things a covered entity or business associate can do is to engage in a half-hearted compliance effort that documents knowledge of uncorrected problems.\\n\\nIn the second case, Arkansas-based QCA Health Plan reported the theft of an unencrypted laptop containing records of 148 individuals. OCR noted that its investigation revealed that QCA failed to comply with multiple requirements of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, beginning from the compliance date of the Security Rule in April 2005 and ending in June 2012. QCA agreed to pay $250,000 and implement upgraded security procedures and employee training. QCA\\'s Resolution Agreement and Corrective Action Plan is here. This case marks only the second time OCR has fined an entity for a breach involving less than 500 individuals\\' PHI, following the Hospice of North Idaho settlement.\\n\\nOne lesson is clear from both incidents: if these laptops had been encrypted in accordance with NIST standards, neither entity would have been subjected to fines and additional government oversight. As enforcement continues to ramp up and target both Covered Entities and Business Associates, and as the use of mobile devices continues to increase, there is no excuse to delay full implementation of encryption.

Unlike via source , a module knows when it\\'s being import ed, which allows code to be executed conditionally only when it is executed directly: if (is.null(module_name())) { … } This is of course similar to Python\\'s if __name__ == \\'__main__\\': … mechanism. module_name returns a module\\'s name. Module source files which are being executed directly don\\'t act as modules and hence have no name ( module_name() is NULL ).\\n\\nModules can import other modules relative to their own path, without having to chdir to the module\\'s path (similar to the source option chdir=TRUE , but preserving getwd() ).\\n\\nimport uses a standardised, customisable search path to locate modules, making it easy to reuse source files across projects without having to copy them around.\\n\\nRepeatedly import ing, even in different modules, loads the module only once. This makes it particularly well-suited for structuring projects into small, decomposable units. This project was mainly borne out of the frustration that is repeatedly source ing the same file, or alternatively having one \"master header\" file which includes all other source files.\\n\\nDoc comments inside a module source file are parsed during import , and interactive help on module contents is subsequently available via the usual mechanisms (e.g. ?mod$fun ).\\n\\nAll module source files are assumed to be encoded as UTF-8, which is nowadays the only sane default.\\n\\nPackages ( library )\\n\\nModules are conceived as a lightweight alternative to packages (see rationale). As such, modules are generally intended to be more lightweight than packages.\\n\\nMost importantly, modules often consist of single source code files.\\n\\nModules do not need a DESCRIPTION file or similar.\\n\\nModules offer more stringent protection against name clashes. While attaching to the R search() path is supported, it\\'s not the default, and (like in Python), it\\'s generally discouraged in favour of explicitly qualifying accesses to the module with the module name (or an alias).\\n\\nChanging a module does not necessitate a module reinstall, the changes are available directly to clients (and even to running sessions, via reload ).\\n\\nModules can be local to a project. This allows structuring projects internally, something that packages only allow at coarse level. In particular, modules can be nested as in Python to create hierarchies, and this is in fact encouraged.\\n\\nAs of now, there is no support for non-R code or dynamic libraries (but one may of course use facilities such as dyn.load and Rcpp to include compiled code).\\n\\nControl over exported and imported symbols is less fine-grained than for packages with namespace for now. This is intentional, since modules handle namespaces (via environments) more stringently than packages by default.

In this example I use the 'M' code within the query editor. I personally think this is a really efficient way to do it, because you can make other small changes to the table within the query editor at the same time.\\n\\nThis video shows you how you can do just that, and how you can do it really quickly in all your models.\\n\\n***** Learning Power BI? *****\\n\\nAll Enterprise DNA TV Resources\\n\\nFREE COURSE – Ultimate Beginners Guide To Power BI\\n\\nFREE COURSE – Ultimate Beginners Guide To DAX\\n\\nFREE – Power BI Resources\",\n",
       " '\"Did you know you can actually negotiate and get a better deal at the doctor\\'s office if you offer to pay up front?\" co-founder and CEO of Collective Health Ali Diab asks.\\n\\nHe\\'d broken his foot and had to go to the doctor for an MRI that would have cost him $3,700, with a $1,500 deductible. Instead it cost just $600 in cash that day. He says that\\'s because he paid for it without going through his insurance provider. This is part of what gave him the idea for Collective Health, a new Founders Fund-backed employer health program launching today. It promises to take the paperwork and runaround out of health insurance.\\n\\nDiab and co-cofounder Dr. Rajaie Batniji, a physician and political economist at Stanford University, paint Collective Health as a way to cut out the middleman (health insurance) and instead offer employers a less expensive, cloud-based, a la cart version of health care coverage for their workers. Employers can pick and choose which things they want covered for their employees. \"We\\'re not building another health app or gadget. We\\'re building a complete solution to replace your employer provided health insurance,\" says Diab.\\n\\nFounders Fund led an undisclosed Series A to back the idea. Formation 8, the Social+Capital Partnership, and prominent angel investors including Scott Banister, Max Levchin, Jeremy Stoppelman and Amr Awadallah also added money in support.\\n\\nThe other part for the idea for Collective Health was first planted when Diab\\'s intestine suddenly twisted up on itself, cutting off the blood supply to about 10 feet of his intestine. \"Nothing could have prevented or predicted this. It was just bad luck,\" says Diab.\\n\\nTo have that happen is a scary and life threatening experience. And then, just as he was struggling to regain his strength, his health insurer didn\\'t want to pay his fees. Diab says he\\'d been paying for premium coverage for years in the event of something like this happening. Instead of the help he needed, he was left with papers up to his gut in legalese and medical insurance loop-de-loops he didn\\'t understand. It was either pay up or face legal action, ruined credit and further unnecessary hardship.\\n\\nDiab\\'s story is not unique. Dr. Batniji has seen it over and over again while working in the medical field. \"Patients are often left to advocate for themselves and trying to get a clear answer from your health insurance company about what\\'s driving costs is impossible,\" says Dr. Batniji. According to NerdWallet, one in every 5 American adults are struggling to pay their medical bills, and three in five bankruptcies will be due to medical bills. And to add more insult to any possible injuries, over the last 10 years, the average premium for family coverage has increased 80 percent, according to ACA International. It was a 90 percent increase from 2008 to 2009, according to data provided from Wellpoint, Cigna and United Health (see chart below).\\n\\nThe problem, according to Diab and Dr. Batniji, is that even with Obamacare or employee sponsored health insurance, annual premiums are increasing. They say the costs are growing at an unsustainable rate for most small and midsize companies to handle. This, according to Diab, makes it hard to offer a good plan for employees. \"While insurance is supposed to be a risk\\xad-sharing business, health insurance has increasingly become a middleman business devised to generate profit for the health insurers above all else. As a result, there is a fundamental disconnect between the incentives of traditional health insurance companies and people\\'s and organizations\\' health insurance needs,\" says Diab.\\n\\nDiab and Dr. Batniji started asking questions like \"Why have insurance premiums and deductibles risen so much faster than underlying health care costs over the past twenty years?\" and \"Why do we receive something in the mail after seeing the doctor that looks like a bill, but says \\'THIS IS NOT A BILL\\' at the top?\" \"It\\'s like entering a time warp back to 1980,\" Diab says. Several long bike rides and early morning coffees later, Dr. Batniji and Diab decided it was up to them to figure out a better way to fixing how Americans pay for health care.\\n\\nThe startup now employs 25 people in a San Mateo office and Collective Health is currently \"renting\" insurance services off of a certain network that it is not at liberty to name at this time. Payments processing is also in the works and Diab says it will eventually be like a square or pay pall software. Collective Health also adds in cost comparisons and which doctors are in your network. It also includes a data visualization element not currently offered by any health insurance provider. The data shows you how much you can expect to pay, above your premium. This, says Diab, better prepares someone for what it should cost than just mailing something',\n",
       " 'Whoring is like military service…okay in the upper brackets, not so good lower down. – Robert A. Heinlein\\n\\nMany Americans like to pretend that all prostitutes are streetwalkers. I say \"pretend\" because, though I am sure there are some ill-informed folks out there who simply don\\'t know any better, I am equally sure the vast majority of people in this country know of the existence of call girls, escorts, massage parlor girls, brothel girls, lawyers and other types of prostitutes. Yet, even so, say \"prostitute\" to the average American and the picture that will pop into his (or her) mind is the stereotypical underdressed, overly made up streetwalker leaning against a lamp post and smoking a cigarette. Ignore for a minute that this stereotype isn\\'t even true of many streetwalkers; the real question is, why? How is it that the word \"prostitute\", broad and clinical as it is, has come to mean for most Americans only those women at the very bottom of our profession? I can\\'t be sure of all the reasons, but I have some educated guesses I would like to share with you.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, of course, is that streetwalkers are ubiquitous. To my knowledge no one has ever done a world census of whores, but The National Task Force on Prostitution estimates that, of the entire female prostitute community in America, only five to twenty percent are street walkers (that\\'s an average estimate of 12.5%, so let\\'s be generous and say 15%). And unlike the brothel girls and massage girls (who are only encountered in their own places of business) or call girls and escorts (who are difficult to tell apart from other women), streetwalkers stand out; they\\'re hard to miss when they\\'re present. Since they have no advertising and/or place of business, how else could they attract clientele? They have to be visible, and they have to advertise their profession so as not to be overlooked. Hence, the flashy and/or revealing clothes favored by many (though by no means all) of them. On top of that, they are more thinly spread; I daresay there are a few streetwalkers in many towns too small for a massage parlor or escort service. All the streetwalker needs to set up shop is a pair of shoes.\\n\\nIt\\'s quite likely that just about everyone reading this has seen a few streetwalkers in his life (probably more than just a few), and since they do stand out they make a strong impression. It is the nature of the human mind to stereotype, which is of course how prejudices are formed. It is unfortunately not much of a leap for a person to go from \"I saw some prostitutes who looked like sleazy drug addicts\" to \"all prostitutes are sleazy drug addicts.\" Or to go from \"I read in the paper that many crimes are committed by black men\" to \"all black men are criminals.\" And so on. Even if the rational mind knows that not ALL members of a group are like its lowest elements, the temptation to classify any given member of that group as the lowest common denominator is very strong indeed. And when the people who are doing the stereotyping are in positions of authority, abominations like racial profiling are the inevitable result.\\n\\nAnother source of the stereotype is movies and television shows. The Hollywood prostitute is a curious creature; she looks like a call girl but dresses and acts like a streetwalker (except for her heart of gold). This applies only to main characters, of course; seedy-looking streetwalkers may be added to a street scene to give it a more run-down, low-class, skid row sort of atmosphere. Once in a great while there will be a high-class call girl (or a courtesan if the show is set far enough in the past), but this is a very rare exception. In the universe of movies and television, streetwalkers outnumber the rest of us by many hundreds to one. And considering how tenacious visual images can be, this false picture is permanently imbedded in the minds of many people.\\n\\nFinally, there\\'s the vulgar appeal of the streetwalker. Many people are fascinated by vulgarity; our youth idolizes entertainers who adopt the personas of \"gangstas\", thugs, \"pimps\", skinheads and other lowlifes. The tabloids dwell on the lowest, sleaziest activities of celebrities, especially those celebrities who are merely famous specimens of what I grew up calling \"white trash.\" Television shows such as Jerry Springer, Cops and the numerous courtroom and \"reality\" shows present the worst, lowest, nastiest, sickest, most tawdry examples of human behavior as \"entertainment\". Vulgarity sells. And considering that, is it any surprise that most Americans would rather think about streetwalkers than call girls?\\n\\nSo',\n",
       " 'By: Paul Goldberg, Staff Writer\\n\\nAustralia\\'s ruling party will once again attempt to resolve their bitter internal differences over the debate of same-sex marriage at a special meeting which was held Monday.\\n\\nThe ruling party is desperate to find a policy agreement on same-sex marriage as it is being considered a test of prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull\\'s agenda. Making matters worse is the fact that the ruling party has trailed the center-left opposition Labor Party over the past several months in opinion polls.\\n\\nThe conservative Liberal Party-led coalition narrowly was re-elected at elections last July with a promise to let voters decide whether Australia should recognize same-sex marriage through a popular vote.\\n\\nLiberal Senator. Dean Smith, a gay man who opposed legalizing same-sex marriage when he was appointed to the Senate in 2012, has drafted a bill to allow gay marriage now and wants his fellow Liberal lawmakers to be allowed to vote on it according to their consciences rather than to according to party policy.\\n\\n\"It\\'s time for the party to put the matter to rest once and for all,\" Smith told reporters on Monday.\\n\\nGay marriage opponents, including former Prime Minister Tony Abbott who initiated the plebiscite policy two year ago, argue that the government must stick to its election promise that marriage law would not be changed without a national vote.\\n\\n\"The last thing Australia needs is government by opinion poll,\" Abbott wrote in The Australian newspaper. \"But neither do we need political parties that believe one thing one minute and the opposite the next,\" said Abbott.\\n\\nTurnbull continues to support gay marriage and initially opposed the plebiscite concept. However Turnbull did agree to maintain the government\\'s plebiscite policy in a deal with the most conservative lawmakers in his party when he replaced Abbott as prime minister in September 2015.',\n",
       " \"We're fighting for policy changes that will make it possible for us to have better choices: utilities that offer us renewable options, electric trains that make short-haul flights obsolete, public transit. Exxon and its ilk have been fighting for decades to keep these choices out of our reach, and then claim that we are voting with our dollars every time we sit in traffic or heat our homes with fossil fuels supplied by a utility that has a monopoly. They can play gotcha as much as they want, but all it proves is how badly we need better options. And we are still going to fight like heck to make sure options are available to everyone.\\n\\nAnd yet, for all that logic, I still find myself on edge. To be watched so much is a kind of never-ending nightmare. And sometimes it's just infuriating. I skipped the funeral this summer of Patrick Sorrento, an important mentor to me at my college newspaper, because I didn't want my minder to follow me and cause a distracting spectacle. When my daughter reports someone taking pictures of her at the airport, it drives me nuts. I have no idea if it's actually this outfit; common decency would suggest otherwise, but that seems an increasingly rare commodity.\\n\\nThere's plenty else that scares me this summer, of course: Every month we're breaking temperature records, and Donald J. Trump has introduced a new snarl to our public life. Against these fears, the best one can hope for is a kind of resiliency. For a planet in desperate trouble, it's good news that the price of a solar panel has plummeted. For our nation, there's the hope that the social fabric — the Little Leagues and Methodist churches and Black Lives Matter assemblies and League of Women Voters and library guilds and N.A.A.C.P. chapters — remain just strong enough that we'll escape the narcissistic nihilism of Mr. Trump.\\n\\nAs for me, there's comfort in the knowledge that the climate movement doesn't depend on me. For years now, I've been stepping back, mostly because I think the kind of movement we need is one that has thousands of leaders in thousands of places, connected like the solar panels on the roofs of an entire planet.\\n\\nIt's stronger that way, because different voices bring different arguments to the fore. But another good reason for that distributed model, one that I've thought of often this summer, is that even a successful attack on one person does little damage to the whole movement, in the same way that you can smash the solar panels on my roof and not black out the Eastern Seaboard.\\n\\nWhen that doesn't cheer me up sufficiently, I fall back on my colleagues all over the world. A good thing about movements is that you really do have brothers and sisters, and they do have your back. The fossil-fuel industry may threaten us as a planet, as a nation, and as individuals, but when we rise up together we've got a fighting chance against the powers that be.\\n\\nAnd perhaps that realization is just a little bit scary for them.\",\n",

We\\'re in the business of using people!\"\\n\\nSo I finally got around to watching Dollhouse. I\\'m writing this article as I go, episode by episode, so you can expect it to get a bit incoherent and a bit rambling.Obviously I went into the show with a fair few preconceptions about what it was going to be like, and it would be remiss of me not to admit that this coloured my experience of it.I should also say that I am in no way disputing the fact that Joss Whedon makes excellent TV. The problem is that he makes excellent TV which sometimes whacks you in the face with a gigantic disembodied penis with the words \"look how serious and morally complex I am\" tattooed on the side.Got that image firm in your minds? Good.Also. Spoilers.The first episode opens with a fragment of Echo\\'s induction into the Dollhouse. Something bad has happened, and the Dollhouse is willing to make it all go away if she\\'ll sign up for a five year mission to explore strange new … umm … to work for them for five years.There\\'s a bit of classic Whedonesque dialogue in this scene which set my teeth on edge. It goes something like this:Two things. No. Three things:First. Stepfrom the Themehammer. Okay, we get it, they\\'re going to erase her personality but because of her Awesome Girlpower they won\\'t succeed. Fabulous. You don\\'t need to drive it into my head like a railroad spike.Second. Okay, Joss, we know you like playing with language, we know you like deconstructing metaphors (he\\'s like Pratchett in this regard) but really \"have you ever tried to clean a slate\" what theThird. Who the fucktried to clean a slate? Was Echo some kind of slate-studies graduate? Was she majoring in sedimentary rock formations? About the only people I can think of who would work with slate regularly are art students, and in that case you\\'d think they\\'d view a \"clean slate\" as something like a \"clean piece of paper\" – something completely new rather than something that has had the old stuff scrubbed off of it. In fact, surely that\\'s why one needs a \"clean slate\" – because one\\'s old slate is dirty from all the stuff that\\'s been on it.Sorry, that was a massive digression.So we go on from Echo being spunkily inducted into the Dollhouse to Echo riding around spunkily on a motorbike, where she flirts spunkily with this rich dude who she appears to have been having an awesome weekend of hot bondagey sex with. Then he goes to get a drink, and she goes spunkily outside and gets into a spunky black van, where she is taken back to the Dollhouse for her \"treatment\".As she goes, the hot billionaire likens her to Cinderella at the ball, getting back into her coach before it turns into a pumpkin.Back at the Dollhouse, she talks animatedly about how happy she is, and how glad she is that she\\'s finally found the right guy. Then they wipe her brain. Then there is aof exposition.I\\'m not going to go too far into the \"is it rape or isn\\'t it\" question right now – I\\'m sure there\\'ll be time to cover that later. What I am going to mention is the way that this is presented.Echo\\'s \"Engagement\" (as the Dollhouse insists on calling it) with Rich Dude is presented in an unremittingly positive light. She\\'s happy, he\\'s happy, it\\'s just All Over Too Soon and she has to go back to the Magic Kingdom to be put into her Enchanted Sleep. The only flaw presented in the scenario is the fact that it is not \"real\". The fact that Echo spent three days having sex with this guy because she had been compelled to do so by high-tech mind control is not addressed – not merely addressed ambiguously',\n",

       " 'Background\\n\\nSubstantial concerns have been raised about the neuropsychiatric safety of the smoking cessation medications varenicline and bupropion. Their efficacy relative to nicotine patch largely relies on indirect comparisons, and there is limited information on safety and efficacy in smokers with psychiatric disorders. We compared the relative neuropsychiatric safety risk and efficacy of varenicline and bupropion with nicotine patch and placebo in smokers with and without psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nWe did a randomised, double-blind, triple-dummy, placebo-controlled and active-controlled (nicotine patch; 21 mg per day with taper) trial of varenicline (1 mg twice a day) and bupropion (150 mg twice a day) for 12 weeks with 12-week non-treatment follow-up done at 140 centres (clinical trial centres, academic centres, and outpatient clinics) in 16 countries between Nov 30, 2011, and Jan 13, 2015. Participants were motivated-to-quit smokers with and without psychiatric disorders who received brief cessation counselling at each visit. Randomisation was computer generated (1:1:1:1 ratio). Participants, investigators, and research personnel were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a composite measure of moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events. The main efficacy endpoint was biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence for weeks 9–12. All participants randomly assigned were included in the efficacy analysis and those who received treatment were included in the safety analysis. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01456936 ) and is now closed.\\n\\nFindings\\n\\n8144 participants were randomly assigned, 4116 to the psychiatric cohort (4074 included in the safety analysis) and 4028 to the non-psychiatric cohort (3984 included in the safety analysis). In the non-psychiatric cohort, 13 (1·3%) of 990 participants reported moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events in the varenicline group, 22 (2·2%) of 989 in the bupropion group, 25 (2·5%) of 1006 in the nicotine patch group, and 24 (2·4%) of 999 in the placebo group. The varenicline–placebo and bupropion–placebo risk differences (RDs) for moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events were −1·28 (95% CI −2·40 to −0·15) and −0·08 (−1·37 to 1·21), respectively; the RDs for comparisons with nicotine patch were −1·07 (−2·21 to 0·08) and 0·13 (−1·19 to 1·45), respectively. In the psychiatric cohort, moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported in 67 (6·5%) of 1026 participants in the varenicline group, 68 (6·7%) of 1017 in the bupropion group, 53 (5·2%) of 1016 in the nicotine patch group, and 50 (4·9%) of 1015 in the placebo group. The varenicline–placebo and bupropion–placebo RDs were 1·59 (95% CI −0·42 to 3·59) and 1·78 (−0·24 to 3·81), respectively; the RDs versus nicotine patch were 1·22 (−0·81 to 3·25) and 1·42 (−0·63 to 3·46), respectively. Varenicline-treated participants achieved higher abstinence rates than those on placebo (odds ratio [OR] 3·61, 95% CI 3·07 to 4·24), nicotine patch (1·68, 1·46 to 1·93), and bupropion (1·75, 1·52 to 2·01). Those on bupropion and nicotine patch achieved higher abstinence rates than those on placebo (OR 2·07 [1·75 to 2·45] and 2·15 [1·82 to 2·54], respectively). Across cohorts, the most frequent adverse events by treatment group were nausea (varenicline, 25% [511 of 2016 participants]), insomnia (bupropion, 12% [245 of 2006 participants]), abnormal dreams (nicotine patch, 12% [251 of 2022 participants]), and headache (placebo, 10% [199 of 2014 participants]). Efficacy treatment comparison did not differ by cohort.\\n\\nInterpretation\\n\\nThe study did not show a significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo. Varenicline was more effective than placebo, nicotine patch, and bupropion in helping smokers achieve abstinence, whereas bupropion and nicotine patch were more effective than placebo.\\n\\nFunding\\n\\nPfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.',\n",

       " 'Why do Santa\\'s reindeer fly? The role of ancient mushroom-using shamans\\n\\nby Mark Adams\\n\\nThese red and white mushrooms, Amanita muscaria, were found in an alpine forest around Creede, Colorado. A. muscaria was the \"sacred mushroom\" used by the ancient tribal peoples of pre-Christian northern Europe. Its bright coloring suggests the colors of Santa\\'s garments and of holiday lights.\\n\\nAlthough most people see Christmas as a Christian holiday, most of the symbols and icons we associate with Christmas celebrations are actually derived from the shamanistic traditions of the tribal peoples of pre-Christian northern Europe.\\n\\nThe sacred mushroom of these people was the red and white Amanita muscaria, also known as \"fly agaric.\" This mushroom commonly is seen in books of fairy tales and usually is associated with magic and fairies. It contains potent hallucinogenic compounds once used by ancient peoples for insight and transcendental experiences. Most of the major elements of the modern Christmas celebration, such as Santa Claus, Christmas trees, magical reindeer and the giving of gifts, are originally based upon the traditions surrounding the harvest and consumption of this most sacred mushroom.\\n\\nThe World Tree\\n\\n\\nAncient peoples, including the Lapps of modern-day Finland, and the Koyak tribes of the central Russian steppes, believed in the idea of a World Tree. The World Tree was seen as a kind of cosmic axis onto which the planes of the universe are fixed. The roots of the World Tree stretch down into the underworld, its trunk is the \"middle earth\" of everyday existence, and its branches reach upwards into the heavenly realm.\\n\\nAmanita muscaria grows only under certain types of trees, mostly firs and evergreens. The cap of the mushroom is the fruit of the larger mycelium beneath the soil which exists in a symbiotic relationship with the roots of the tree. To ancient people, this mushroom was literally \"the fruit of the tree.\"\\n\\nThe North Star was also considered sacred, since all other stars in the sky revolved around its fixed point. They associated this \"Pole Star\" with the World Tree and the central axis of the universe. The top of the World Tree touched the North Star, and the spirit of the shaman would climb the metaphorical tree, thereby passing into the realm of the gods. This is the true meaning of the star on top of the modern Christmas tree, and also the reason that the super-shaman Santa makes his home at the North Pole.\\n\\nAncient peoples were amazed at how this magical mushroom sprang from the earth without any visible seed. They considered this \"virgin birth\" to have been the result of the morning dew, which was seen as the \"semen of the deity.\" The silver tinsel we drape onto our modern Christmas tree represents this divine fluid.\\n\\n\\nOrigin of phrase, \"to get pissed\"\\n\\nThe active ingredients of A. muscaria are not metabolized by the body, and so they remain active in the urine. In fact, it is safer to drink the urine of one who has consumed the mushroom than to eat the mushroom directly, as many of the toxic compounds are processed and eliminated on the first pass through the body.\\n\\nIt was common practice among ancient people to recycle the potent effects of the mushroom by drinking each other\\'s urine. The mushroom\\'s ingredients can remain potent even after six passes through the human body. Some scholars argue that this is the origin of the phrase \"to get pissed,\" as this urine-drinking activity preceded alcohol by thousands of years.\\n\\nReindeer were the sacred animals of these semi-nomadic people, as the reindeer provided food, shelter, clothing and other necessities. Reindeer are also fond of eating the mushroom; they will seek it out, then prance about while under its influence. Often the urine of tripped-out reindeer would be consumed for its psychedelic effects.\\n\\nThis effect goes the other way too, as reindeer also enjoy the urine of a human, especially one who has consumed the mushroom.

       " \"ABSTRACT\\n\\nBackground: Biochemical and behavioral evidence has suggested that the ratio of n-6 (omega-6) to n-3 (omega-3) could be an important predictor of executive function abilities in children. Objective: We determined the relation between the ratio of n-6 to n-3 and cognitive function in children. We hypothesized that children with lower ratios of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids would perform better on tests of planning and working memory. Design: Seventy 7- to 9-y-old children completed three 24-h diet recalls and a subset of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Assessment Battery. Parents provided information on their demographics and children's diet histories. Results: Mean n-3 and mean n-6 intakes were related to the mean time spent on each action taken in the planning problem. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 significantly predicted performance on the working memory and planning problems. There was a significant interaction between the ratio and fatty acid intake; when children had high ratios, a higher intake of n-3 fatty acids predicted a better performance on the planning task than when children had lower n-3 intakes. When children had low ratios, a lower intake of n-3 and lower intake of n-6 predicted better performance than when intakes were higher. Conclusions: The relation between cognitive abilities and the ratio of n-6 to n-3 may be mediated by an enzymatic affinity for n-3 fatty acids. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 should be considered an important factor in the study of fatty acids and cognitive development. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01823419.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nHigh omega-6 (n-6) to omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid ratios may be a preventable cause of cognitive and behavioral difficulties in children (1, 2). Fatty acids comprise all neuronal phospholipid membranes (3). Arachidonic acid (AA)4 (20:4n-6) and DHA (22:6n-3) make up 23% of the total lipids in the adult human cortex (4) where they play prominent roles in neurotransmitter metabolism (5, 6), synaptic growth (7), and neuronal communication (7, 8). In animals, AA and DHA are synthesized from their precursors linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), respectively (9–12). In humans, α-linolenic acid has been shown to convert to EPA, docosapentaenoic acid, and, although still debated, DHA in plasma (13–16; see reference 17 for a counterargument). The rate of conversion is not known in humans but may be quite low in part because of an imbalanced consumption of n-6 and n-3.\\n\\nThe ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids is important because the pathways share enzymes such that the ratio of fatty acids consumed may dictate the availability of desaturase and elongase further down the metabolic pathways (seeFigure 1 for an illustration of shared resources). This effect may be detrimental to cognition because the n-3 most prevalent in the brain (ie, DHA) is one of the final steps in the n-3 pathway. Δ-6 Desaturase, which is thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, is required twice in the metabolism of DHA (Figure 1) but could be depleted in the first desaturase step. Thus, endogenous DHA is likely low in individuals who eat high amounts of n-6 and low amounts of n-3 (ie, the typical American diet) (18).\\n\\nFIGURE 1. View largeDownload slide n-6 and n-3 fatty acid metabolic pathways. FADS1, fatty acid desaturase 1; FADS2, fatty acid desaturase 2.\\n\\nFIGURE 1. View largeDownload slide n-6 and n-3 fatty acid metabolic pathways. FADS1, fatty acid desaturase 1; FADS2, fatty acid desaturase 2.\\n\\nBiochemical (19–21) and behavioral (1, 2, 22, 23) evidence has indicated that the balance of n-6 and n-3 may be important for cognition (24). Cognitive abilities known as executive functions develop when children are 3–10 y old (25–27) and are subserved by the temporal and frontal lobes (28–30). During this period of development, cortical gray matter increases rapidly in the frontal areas (31–33). The hippocampus (in the temporal lobes) and prefrontal cortex continue to develop beyond the first 2 y of life (31, 34–36) and have particularly high concentrations of AA and DHA (37, 38). AA (20) and DHA (39, 40) play important roles\",\n",

       " 'Coastal Carolina won the College World Series in dramatic fashion. The Marlins traded for Fernando Rodney. The Dodgers acquired Bud Norris as Clayton Kershaw went on the DL. The Giants let MadBum hit for himself in an American League park (and he doubled). Our top five:\\n\\n1. Danny Salazar could start the All-Star Game and he may not be the best starter on the Indians. Here\\'s what Carlos Carrasco did against the Blue Jays as the Indians won their 13th game in a row: 7 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 2 BB, 14 SO. He missed time with a hamstring injury, so he has made just 10 starts this season, but Carrasco is 4-2 with a 2.56 ERA while holding batters to a .225 average. If we go back to July 11 -- yes, cherry-picking that date -- here are the lowest ERAs among AL starters:\\n\\nDanny Salazar: 2.65\\n\\nCarlos Carrasco: 2.78\\n\\nMarco Estrada: 2.79\\n\\nCarrasco, however, has the highest strikeout rate at 29.1 percent, bettered by only five National League pitchers (Jose Fernandez, Stephen Strasburg, Kershaw, Max Scherzer, Noah Syndergaard). Carrasco has allowed a .271 woBA compared to Salazar\\'s .274 (Estrada is at .261). It\\'s close, but you can make an argument that Carrasco is better than Salazar, or at least at the same level. The one knock against him so far is he has allowed 10 home runs in 63⅓ innings, kind of making him the Scherzer of the AL. Anyway, the major point here: Carrasco is good. Salazar is good. Corey Kluber is good. The Indians are good.\\n\\nCarlos Carrasco with a 14 K game. The #Indians starters are pitching like Bob Feller, Bob Lemon, Mike Garcia and Early Wynn.

Give the Nationals credit. In the early season, everyone wanted the Nationals to call up shortstop prospect Trea Turner. Because we love shiny new things! Turner is obviously a legit prospect and he was (and is) hitting well in Triple-A. When Espinosa hit .185 in April and then .208 in May, leaving Turner down looked like a mistake. Maybe the Nationals were just saving on service time, or maybe they were worried Turner was averaging a strikeout a game. Or maybe Dusty Baker just likes veterans. Whatever the reason, they stuck with Espinosa, and he produced a monster June, including homers from both sides of the plate Thursday as part of a seven-RBI night as the Nats crushed the Reds. Espinosa hit .309/.418/.704 in June with nine home runs and 21 RBIs, making him a player of the month candidate. Meanwhile, Turner has played a couple games in center field down at Syracuse ... you know, just in case they want to call him up.\\n\\nGio on Danny Espinosa: \"In Danny we trust. He looks like a stone cold killer up there.\" — Dan Kolko (@masnKolko) July 1, 2016\\n\\n3. The most exciting save of the year. Fun game between the Cubs and Mets. The Mets scored three runs in the seventh to take a 4-3 lead -- no idea why the Cubs thought signing Joel Peralta was a good idea -- but Jeurys Familia\\'s streak of 42 consecutive regular-season saves was in jeopardy in the ninth inning after Miguel Montero walked and Ben Zobrist doubled pinch-runner Travis Wood to third base. Familia then struck out Kris Bryant and Willson Contreras (around an intentional walk to Anthony Rizzo) with a bunch of darting, diving, 97-mph sinkers that were moving down and in. Unhittable pitches, although some columnist out there will probably suggest that Bryant is overrated and can\\'t hit good pitching.

The court has also set the date of 11 April to announce its verdict concerning other defendants in the case. The court has referred the death sentences to Egypt\\'s Grand Mufti for revision. The referral of the sentences to the Mufti is the first step in the legal process required to enact a death sentence. The Mufti\\'s decision is not binding. However, following his decision the court will issue a final verdict. Once a final verdict is issued, defendants can appeal. Badie and another 13 Brotherhood figures are convicted of setting up an operation after the violent dispersal of the Rabaa Al-Adaweya protest camp in mid-August in 2013 to direct the movements of Brotherhood supporters across the country as part of plans to defy the state and spread chaos, as well as plot attacks on police stations, private property and churches.\\n\\nSoltan was arrested in September 2013 as he tried to flee to Sudan, and was charged with incitement to kill and attempted murder.\\n\\nHis son Mohamed, who has become a cause celebre for the American media and U.S. Islamic organizations, was also convicted in the current case and will be sentenced on April 11:\\n\\nMohamed\\'s father, Salah Soltan, has been sentenced to death..

I noted here that multiple Western media reports at the time identified Mohamed as one of the top leaders organizing the violent Muslim Brotherhood protests in Cairo following Morsi\\'s removal from office.\\n\\nSalah Soltan has also been the subject of several of my reports here at PJ Media going back to January 2009 when he appeared on Al-Nas TV threatening America with death and destruction for its support of Israel.\\n\\nAt the same time the elder Soltan was threatening America on Middle East TV, his son Mohamed was seen leading anti-Jewish genocidal chants in front of the Ohio Statehouse (as I reported here last week):\\n\\nSalah Soltan was also a leading figure at the Muslim Brotherhood protests dispersed by Egyptian authorities in August 2013, even appearing on stage at the protest standing beside an al-Qaeda flag:\\n\\nOur late PJ Media colleague Barry Rubin noted here in August 2011 that Soltan had issued a fatwa in Egypt authorizing any Muslim to kill any Israeli that could be found in the country. He also took note of the media backlash I had received for reporting on Soltan\\'s extremist activities and open support for Islamic terrorism.\\n\\nI followed up Barry\\'s report with my own observing everything I had written about Salah Soltan going back to my first report in April 2006. Despite all the attempts by the establishment media to paint him as an interfaith moderate, I chronicled a lengthy list of his activities:\\n\\nA year later, Salah Soltan was a senior member of Morsi\\'s Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt. As I reported here in August 2012, Soltan could be seen in his new role visiting with a number of U.S.-designated terrorists and Islamic extremists across the Middle East.\\n\\nThose who have followed my reporting here and elsewhere on Salah and Mohamed Soltan know that my continued interest in their activities was not merely academic, as the pair were my former neighbors in my hometown of Hillard, Ohio.\\n\\nThe elder Soltan even served as religious director of our local mosque, the Noor Islamic Cultural Center.\\n\\nThat story was covered in the 2-part documentary by The Blaze titled The Project. My PJ Media colleague Andrew McCarthy and I were interviewed:\\n\\nWhen Mohamed Soltan burned down their family home in Hilliard as part of a staged \"Islamophobic\" hate crime in January 2012, Soltan repeatedly cited in sworn testimony that my writings',\n",

       " \"Version 0.21: This article may not be up to date for the latest stable release of Crawl.\\n\\nMagic points or Mana points (usually abbreviated to MP) is the amount of magical energy which a given character has. It is used for spellcasting, for invoking divine powers (with the exception of Trog) and for evoking abilities granted by worn items, mutations, and intrinsic abilities.\\n\\nHaving your MP fall to zero is not directly lethal, but can be very hazardous for a spellcaster. MP will regenerate up to your maximum with time, and it is often recommended that spellcasters should rest up to full MP after every fight.\\n\\nSome items like rings of magical power or staves of power can increase a given character's reserves of magical power.\\n\\nYour maximum MP without benefit of items is a function of your experience level, your race, and whichever of your Spellcasting, Evocations, and Invocations skill is higher. Training Spellcasting provides twice as much MP as Invocations or Evocations. Depending on your character, though, this may not be a concern.\\n\\nA typical character starts with 0-7 MP (e.g. 0 for a Minotaur Fighter, 6 for Deep Elf Conjurer, 7 for Deep Elf Wizard) and eventually grows to many times that (30-40 for a level 20 Mummy Necromancer, or 50-60 when using extra items).\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nMP is a very important stat for spellcasters. Early or mid game rings of magical power are extremely useful, since MP costs are low and your base mana pool is small. However, as your MP hits around the 40+ mark, the efficiency of this stat gets drastically lower. Perhaps the only source of MP that you should use at this point is a staff of magical power, but even that could be replaced by an enhancer staff if you find one appropriate for you.\\n\\nMethods of MP restoration:\\n\\nFormula\\n\\nMP modifiers\\n\\nFrom Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup in-game documentation:\\n\\nBa Ce DD DE Dg Ds Dr Fe Fo Gr Gh Gn Ha HO Hu Ko Mf Mi Mu Na Op Og Sp Te Tr Vp VS 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 1 1 -1 0 1\\n\\nDemigods additionally start with the High MP mutation.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n0.17 simplified MP calculations.

Species aptitudes used to be multiplicative, but are now additive.\\n\\nBefore 0.14, the formula was:\\n\\nUnscaled MP = XL + Permanent MP + (XL*Species modifier + 1)/3 + max(Spellcasting*XL/4, Invocations*XL/6, Evocations*XL/6)\\n\\nwhere Permanent MP was a constant determined by the player's background and species.\",\n",

However. Historical fiction has always been an absolute favorite of mine. 9 times out of 10 as a kid, my nose was found in an American Girl book or a Dear America book. I hungrily read anything that could transport me to a time and place and situation other than my own.\\n\\n\\nBoston Jane was a solid historical fiction read. It was well-done, and obviously well-researched, which is something that is always appreciated, of course. I was transported to early 19th century America as I was reading. Jane is a wonderful character, and a truly enjoyable narrator. She is spunky, spirited, and full of determination, whether it\\'s determination to become a lady, or determination to make the best of her circumstances. She was frustratingly true to her time--from referring to the Indians that she meets as \"savages\" (at first) to adamantly sticking to Miss Hepplewhite\\'s \"rules of being a lady\" even when it didn\\'t make sense to act as a lady anymore. She is not a flawless character, but I always like that. I don\\'t always want to read about someone who I like from the get-go. Sometimes, I like to watch a character come into their own as I read, and Jane really does that in this book.\\n\\n\\nJennifer L. Holm also wrote a good cast of supporting characters that I know I will look back and fondly remember (even the not-so-nice ones), including Papa, Sally Biddle, Jehu, Mr. Swan, Mr. Russell, Suis, and Handsome Jim. They were all pretty well fleshed out, and even those who didn\\'t necessarily show character development were characters whom I felt like I knew.\\n\\n\\nAbove all, though, this is an adventure story. Jane\\'s adventure story. She sailed to the opposite coast of the United States to start a new life, but even besides that, there was always something going on. I think this is part of what made it such a solid historical fiction read. With every new happening, the reader gets another glimpse of what life would have entailed in the pioneer west of that time.\\n\\n\\nThis was not the best book I\\'ve ever read, by any means, but it was a solid good read that kept me up late reading on a couple of occasions. The only thing I am unsure of is how to classify this story. If I had to take a stab, I\\'d say this is an older MG/younger YA read. There is a 16-year-old narrator and some events that might be considered a bit mature for some audiences, but the writing itself felt like it was geared towards younger readers. I\\'d recommend this one to maybe older junior high readers looking for a good historical fiction adventure.\\n\\n\\nOn a side note, I did just find out that there are sequels to this. I\\'m not sure if I will continue with the series, though. I liked Boston Jane so much, so I\\'m not sure I want to mar my feelings toward it. In other words, I think this installment can definitely stand on its own. I am curious though...',\n",

       " 'San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor discussed systemic poverty at a forum April 3. (NOWCastSA)\\n\\nA few weeks ago, the World Bank updated its analysis of Global Extreme Poverty, dozens of chapters dedicated to exploring, in minute detail, the many complex and intersecting reasons as to why people are poor.\\n\\nAbout the same time, San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor was asked a similar question about the root causes of poverty in her city. She offered a simple rationale:\\n\\nBroken people.\\n\\nParticularly broken people who don\\'t have a strong relationship with God.\\n\\nThe statement has incensed newly minted critics of Taylor days before the city\\'s mayoral election. They claim it was an insensitive one-two punch of blaming poverty on the poor and asserting that nonreligious people are at the root of society\\'s ills.\\n\\nOn April 3, Taylor (D) and fellow candidate, San Antonio councilman Ron Nirenberg, were at a mayoral forum and took a question from the director of San Antonio\\'s Christian Resource Center, according to the San Antonio Current: \"What do you see as the deepest, systemic causes of generational poverty in San Antonio?\"\\n\\nIn the video, Taylor makes a joke about the hefty nature of the question, asks the questioner to repeat it, then says, \"I\\'ll go ahead and put it out there\":\\n\\nTo me, it\\'s broken people. People not being in relationships with their creator and therefore not being in good relationship with their families and their communities and not being productive members of society. So I mean, I think that\\'s the ultimate answer.\\n\\nAnnie Laurie Gaylor, one of the co-presidents of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, said her organization was prompted to send a letter to Taylor defending people who are not religious.\\n\\n\"As mayor, you represent a diverse population that consists of not only Christians, but also atheists, agnostics, Jews, Muslims, and Hindus,\" the letter said. \" … Nationally, about 35 percent of millennials are nonreligious. Imagine for a moment a mayoral candidate making such undeserved and broad accusations against Jews or Muslims instead of nonbelievers. The outcry would properly be swift and severe. It should be no different for nonbelievers.\"\\n\\nMayor Ivy Taylor (Photo courtesy of Ivy Taylor)\\n\\nGaylor told The Washington Post she feared the mayor\\'s words would send a message to other political leaders that it\\'s okay for religiosity to guide politics.\\n\\n\"As mayor, she has a bully pulpit, but it shouldn\\'t be an actual pulpit,\" Gaylor said. \"It implies the root of all bad things is Godlessness. … San Antonio is not a congregation. She\\'s not a pastor. She\\'s a mayor. We do hope that she\\'ll realize not just what\\'s offensive about it, but that it is so wrong.\"\\n\\nTaylor posted a lengthy statement on her Facebook page, claiming the video clip that surfaced had been selectively edited to misrepresent her views. In particular, she said she doesn\\'t believe that just poor people are \"broken.\"\\n\\n[This mayor won\\'t stop posting racist Obama memes. He won\\'t resign, either.]\\n\\n\"I also believe in Original Sin, and that was the context for my comment in the YouTube video clip. We\\'re all \\'broken,\\' from the richest among us to the poorest, until we forge a relationship with our Maker. I could have expressed myself more clearly in explaining my belief at the forum.\"\\n\\nIn an interview, Taylor told The Post she believes society would be better if people had a stronger relationship with God. But she said she has tried to stress to voters that San Antonio is not a theocracy, and she doesn\\'t believe leaders should govern from the Bible.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if anyone took the time to really understand what I was trying to convey. And if I wasn\\'t effective in communicating that, then I certainly wish I could have been clearer,\" she said.\\n\\n\"The history of our urban areas is that a lot of the policies that have been developed on the federal and local levels have led to the creation of islands of poverty,\" she said. \"I\\'ve spent my career on efforts trying to level the playing field.\"\\n\\nBut as the mayor has tried to explain her thinking, Gaylor said her group felt that she was just affirming the statement about religion and government that they had the biggest problem with.\\n\\n\"There had been a Facebook statement, and it\\'s kind of a non-apology apology,\" Gaylor said. \"This just isn\\'t good enough.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a stereotype that she\\'s perpetuating,\" Gaylor continued. \"We\\'re not criticizing her record combating poverty … we\\'re blaming her for blaming nontheism or non-Godliness for poverty.\"\\n\\nOn the phone with Trey Ware of KTSA 550am.

       " 'The proposed Europa Clipper mission would go into orbit around Jupiter, instead of Europa itself, making several dozen close flybys of the icy moon. At an estimated cost of $2.1 billion, it is less than half the cost of previous Europa orbiter concepts, but NASA is looking for ways to further reduce costs. (credit: NASA/JPL) Europa on the cheap\\n\\nFor decades, scientists have dreamed of sending a mission to Europa, one of Jupiter\\'s four large Galilean moons. The fleeting flybys of the moon by Voyagers 1 and 2 in 1979, and the more frequent flybys by Galileo in the 1990s, revealed a world with a icy crust, crisscrossed by fractures and other complex features. Those and other observations led scientists to conclude that Europa has, below that icy crust, a subterranean ocean of liquid water that, combined with the energy from tidal heating that keeps that ocean liquid and organic compounds, provide the basic requirements for life. Instead of going into orbit around Europa, the Europa Clipper spacecraft would instead go into orbit around Jupiter and make repeated close flybys of the moon. As compelling as the scientific case is for Europa, NASA has yet to send a dedicated mission there. Part of that is due to the technical challenges involved in launching a spacecraft to Jupiter and operating in the high radiation environment created by Jupiter\\'s powerful magnetic field. Those technical obstacles drive up the costs of those proposed missions, and reduce the chances they can be funded. NASA has studied Europa orbiter mission proposals since the late 1990s, but those efforts typically foundered on costs and shifting priorities. In 2011, the latest planetary science decadal survey—the once-per-decade report outlining priorities for planetary science missions based on science and other factors—identified a Europa orbiter as the second-highest priority large, or \"flagship\" mission, behind a rover to collects samples on Mars for later return to Earth. That ranking, though, came with a caveat: an independent study of the mission concluded it would cost $4.7 billion, too high a price tag. For a Europa mission to remain highly ranked, NASA needed to bring down the cost significantly. (See \"Tough decisions ahead for planetary exploration\", The Space Review, April 4, 2011). NASA has been working on reducing a cost of a Europa orbiter mission, in large part by no longer making it an orbiter. The concept now favored within the space agency is something called \"Europa Clipper.\" Instead of going into orbit around Europa, the spacecraft would instead go into orbit around Jupiter and make repeated close flybys of the moon. The most recent mission designs involve 45 flybys of Europa over three and a half years, with the vast majority of them coming within 100 kilometers of the moon\\'s surface. That approach minimizes the spacecraft\\'s exposure to radiation as well as propellant needed for entering orbit around Europa. Europa Clipper is still in its earliest phases, with a mission concept review planned for September. A notional design for the mission, presented at a meeting of NASA\\'s Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) in January, showed a spacecraft equipped with nine instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and an ice-penetrating radar, whose booms extended from either side of the spacecraft\\'s bus like parts of an old-fashioned television antenna. Launched on an Atlas V 551 in November 2021, the spacecraft would arrive at Jupiter in April 2028 after gravity assist flybys of Venus and the Earth. That design has a cost estimate of about $2.1 billion, less than half the independent cost estimate for the earlier Europa orbiter mission in the decadal survey report. That work on Europa Clipper has largely been done at the insistence of Congress, rather than by NASA\\'s own initiative. In the final fiscal year 2013 budget, Congress set aside $75 million of NASA\\'s planetary sciences budget specifically for Europa mission studies, and followed that up with $80 million in the fiscal year 2014 budget, even though NASA requested no money in either year\\'s budget request for Europa. The text of the final 2014 appropriations bill noted that the $80 million \"shall be for pre-formulation and/or formulation activities for a mission that meets the science goals outlined for the Jupiter Europa mission in the most recent planetary science decadal survey.\" When NASA released its fiscal year 2015 budget proposal last month, it contained, for the first time, a line item for Europa mission studies. NASA requested $15 million for fiscal year 2015, but was short on details in the document on how the money would be used. \"Following the analysis of options for a lower-cost Europa mission conducted in FY 2014, NASA will continue developing the architecture for a potential Europa mission,\" the budget justification document stated. \"My desire, to be quite honest, would be to target a Europa mission that we could fly for a billion dollars or less,\" Bolden said. At the formal rollout of the budget March 4, NASA administrator Charles Bolden and chief financial officer Beth Robinson were',\n",
       " 'by Mary Mann\\n\\n\"In the seventies men didn\\'t want women in the dojo,\" Denise Williams told me. \"Susan, my teacher, she was thrown out because she wanted to do knuckle pushups. They said, \"You\\'ll get calluses on your knuckles and nobody will want to marry you.\\'\"\\n\\nShe paused, then added: \"People really did talk like that back then.\"\\n\\nDenise is a small woman in her sixties. She wears big glasses and smiles a lot and practices massage therapy. She\\'s also a karate black belt, and has been head sensei of the Women\\'s Center Karate Club since the eighties, but no more: this fall, shortly after the death of its founder Susan Ribner — who also helped found the National Women\\'s Martial Arts Federation — Denise closed New York City\\'s last women-only karate school.\\n\\nWomen-only karate classes seem, in retrospect, like the perfect apotheosis of 1970s New York. It was one of the city\\'s most violent eras, with approximately 2,000 murders and 5,000 reported rapes per year, not to mention an average of 250 subway felonies each week — the 4 train was known as the Mugger\\'s Express. It was also the heyday of second-wave feminism: Gloria Steinem founded Ms. Magazine, the Black Women\\'s Manifesto was published, the ERA went to Congress and Take Back the Night events began. Feminists everywhere wanted change, and while sometimes the issues one group represented clashed with those of another, one thing women seemed to agree on was the nobody felt all that safe.\\n\\nFrom this fertile ground three women-only karate schools sprang up, simultaneously and independently, within a couple miles of each other. Brooklyn Women\\'s Martial Arts held classes in apartments and at street fairs. The Karate School for Women had a storefront in the West Village. The Women\\'s Center Karate Club operated from the locker-lined bunkroom of a decommissioned firehouse in the West 20s, which they eventually lost due to rising rents — for most of its existence the club operated out of rooms rented by the hour.\\n\\nThough this was the era of consciousness-raising — women gathering to share stories for solidarity — karate was separate from that. Instead they learned chops and kicks and blocks and a confident way of being in the world, best summarized to me by Denise\\'s description of kiai: staring stare someone down while shouting. \"I used to be so shy,\" she says. \"But now, if I look you in the eyes I can just about cut you.\"\\n\\nClass material was the same as in male-dominated karate dojos — the difference wasn\\'t the what but the how. In your typical karate class you begin by tearing the ego down, but in women-only classes you build the ego up — not in a \"you look great\" or \"reach for the stars\" kind of way, but something more like \"yes, your instincts are absolutely right, that guy is bad news.\" Many of the women, Denise suggested, had been through some sort of trauma, and women\\'s karate was about trusting your gut and taking action, a pretty novel lesson in an era when marital rape was legal and women were subject to their husbands\\' whims via \"head and master\" laws. From subway platforms to family rooms, trusting your gut is good advice that\\'s hard to take when you\\'ve been raised with June Cleaver as ideal woman.\\n\\nThough they\\'d all bloomed so suddenly together, the city\\'s women-only karate schools faded away slowly and separately. The Karate School for Women was the first to go: owner Roberta Schine, among whose students was Weather Underground leader Kathy Boudin, closed up shop in 1995 to become a yoga teacher. Also in the nineties, Brooklyn Women\\'s Martial Arts morphed into something else entirely: The Center for Anti-violence Education. Almost twenty years later, in October 2014, the Women\\'s Center Karate Club finally closed its doors.\\n\\nWhy did women-only karate fade away?\\n\\nMaybe women just felt safer, and certainly they had less time, as they were increasingly able to land a variety of jobs but still shouldered most of the household chores. I suspect the waning popularity of karate itself also has had something to do with it. American karate peaked in the eighties, but the glory days of Miyagi coaching Daniel-san in Karate Kid are long over, and strip mall karate now seems shabby next to newer imports: krav maga, muay thai and Brazilian juijitsu, plus the flashy, fast-paced combo of them all — mixed martial arts.\\n\\nWomen still practice karate, and they\\'re allowed in dojos now, but most dojos remain 90% male. This sounds intimidating to me, but for a lot of women it isn\\'t a problem: 31-year-',\n",
       " 'We\\'re now a few weeks removed from Mariano Rivera\\'s final game at Yankee Stadium, which means most sports fans who watched it have had enough time to stop crying while awkwardly insisting that they\\'re not crying.\\n\\nAs a hockey fan, I watched Rivera\\'s exit while thinking How can I take that wonderful baseball moment and translate it into a hockey post? And that\\'s how I came up with the idea of listing 10 legendary NHL players who, like Rivera, played their entire career with one team.\\n\\nAnd then I thought How can I take this idea for a feel-good walk through the pages of hockey history and turn it into an excuse for people to yell at each other? And that\\'s when I decided that instead of just listing 10 guys, I\\'d also rank them.\\n\\nSo here we go: the 10 best players in NHL history, in order, among those who spent their entire career with one franchise.\\n\\n10. Denis Potvin, New York Islanders (1973-1988)\\n\\nPotvin won three Norris Trophies and four Stanley Cups during a 15-year career in which he established himself as one of the most respected\\n\\nHold on, I need to pause for a minute while all the Ranger fans chant \"Potvin Sucks\" for a while.\\n\\nStill waiting.\\n\\nStill waiting\\n\\nOK, you know what, there are only so many hours in the day so let\\'s just agree that Potvin was one of the most-respected players in the league as long as you weren\\'t in Madison Square Garden. He captained the Islanders\\' early \\'80s dynasty that captured four straight championships and won 19 consecutive postseason series, a record that likely stands as completely unbreakable in the salary-cap era. He averaged just less than a point per game over his career, and retired as the league\\'s all-time leading scorer among defensemen.\\n\\nAs for you still-chanting Rangers fans, here\\'s a fun fact: Potvin claimed that Mike Keenan asked him to make a comeback and join the 1993-94 Rangers team that eventually won the Stanley Cup. Potvin, who by then was 41 years old and had been out of hockey for six years, considered the offer but eventually declined.\\n\\n9. Stan Mikita, Chicago Blackhawks (1958-1980)\\n\\nMikita was a gifted scorer who combined with Bobby Hull to give the Blackhawks the most feared offensive duo of the 1960s. He led the league in points four times in a five-year stretch, won two MVPs, and helped the Blackhawks win a Stanley Cup in 1961 that would be the franchise\\'s last for 49 years.\\n\\nBut beyond the stats, Mikita had a fascinating career. He was one of the first European-born players to star in the NHL. He was among the first of what we now consider the prototypical two-way center, dominating at both ends of the ice and becoming an excellent faceoff man. He and Hull helped pioneered the use of curved blades. Over the years he transformed from one of the league\\'s most penalized players to an eventual Lady Byng winner. And he even designed and marketed his own style of helmet. A horrible, ugly helmet.\\n\\n8. Mike Bossy, New York Islanders (1977-1987)\\n\\nQuick: Who\\'s the NHL\\'s all-time leader in goals per game? OK, it\\'s obviously Mike Bossy since the question is appearing in his section. But if it weren\\'t for that giveaway, wouldn\\'t you have guessed someone like Mario Lemieux or Pavel Bure or Brett Hull first? It shouldn\\'t be possible to own the record for most consecutive 50-goal seasons and still be criminally underrated, but Bossy comes close to pulling it off.\\n\\nThis is because of injury problems that cut his career short. Bossy had only turned 30 during the 1986-87 season, but his back was already a mess. He took the next season off in hopes of mounting a comeback, but it wasn\\'t to be, and he retired after playing just 10 seasons.\\n\\nEven by the insane standards of the 1980s, Bossy\\'s numbers were eye-popping. Nine consecutive 50-goal seasons. Five 60-goal years. A 50-in-50 season in 1981. A career shooting percentage of 21.2 percent.\\n\\nIn what\\'s becoming a bit of a running theme among players on this list, Bossy almost didn\\'t qualify. While pondering a comeback, he was rumored to be offered to his hometown Canadiens (who had famously passed on him in the 1977 draft, taking Mark Napier instead). But the deal never happened, and Bossy officially retired in the summer of 1988.\\n\\n7. Joe Sakic, Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche (1988-2009)\\n\\nSakic counts, right? We said we were ranking guys who played for one franchise, so we can\\'t use the fact that the Nordiques became the Avalanche against him. He',\n",

       " 'ONE difficulty of reporting on spy outfits like America\\'s National Security Agency is the veil of secrecy they operate behind. This makes it hard to know exactly what they are and aren\\'t capable of. It is also one reason why Edward Snowden\\'s revelations have been so fascinating. They offer a glimpse—limited and incomplete, to be sure—behind the curtain, and help to constrain the bounds of just what such agencies can do.\\n\\nTake a recent post on Wired\\'s security blog. It discusses the latest Snowden leak, which details the size of America\\'s secret-intelligence budget. In particular, Wired picks up on James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, talking about investing in \"groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities to defeat adversarial cryptography and exploit internet traffic\". And it links to another post in which James Bamford, a veteran chronicler of the NSA, describes the agency as having made \"an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users\". That sounds a lot like saying that the the spooks have managed to break at least some of the cryptographic codes that protect everything from secure e-mail to e-commerce.\\n\\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor\\'s Picks.\\n\\n\\nIf true, it would be a very big story indeed. Such codes are ubiquitous because they are widely thought to be secure. If such a breakthrough has indeed happened (and Mr Snowden, for one, has said that it hasn\\'t) what would it look like? Not being privy to the NSA\\'s deepest secrets, Babbage has no idea. But he can speculate.\\n\\nThe most likely (and least interesting) answer is that the NSA has found a bug in the way that specific programs implement cryptographic protocols. Such flaws are fairly common, and can usually be fixed simply by patching the software. (Though that relies on people finding the flaws and then sharing that information widely, which NSA would be unlikely to do.) However, Mr Clapper\\'s and Mr Bamford\\'s use of \"groundbreaking\" and \"breakthrough\" to describe the NSA\\'s advances could be read as suggesting that something more fundamental could be at hand—perhaps even a flaw in the mathematics that underpin cryptography.\\n\\nElectronic cryptography relies on the curious fact that some mathematical operations are easy to do in one direction but virtually impossible to perform in reverse. For example, multiplying two enormous prime numbers together to get a third colossal number is easy. But, analysing a colossal number produced in this way and trying to determine its prime factors is colossally difficult. So difficult, in fact, that it stumps even the world\\'s snappiest supercomputers. This bit of mathematics—integer factorisation in the argot—forms the foundation of most of the internet\\'s cryptographic systems (codes based on other kinds of mathematical operation exist, but they aren\\'t as commonly used).\\n\\nResearchers already know that it is possible, in theory, to break such encryption by building a quantum computer, an unusual machine that relies on various kinds of quantum weirdness to perform its calculations. A mathematician called Peter Shor proved in 1993 that such a computer could be used to speed up integer factorisation drastically, to the point where much of the internet\\'s existing security infrastructure would be useless.\\n\\nDoes the NSA have a quantum computer in the basement of its headquarters in Maryland (pictured above)? It is theoretically possible, but pretty unlikely. For building a working quantum computer is itself terribly tricky. University laboratories have been trying for years, but the technology is finicky and progress has been slow. The record for prime factorisation using Shor\\'s algorithm currently stands at the number \"21\", which was split into its prime factors (7 and 3) in 2012. A Canadian firm called D-Wave is presently selling a specialised kind of quantum computer—Lockheed Martin, an American defence giant, and Google have each bought one—but it is not suitable for this kind of work. And contrary to spy thrillers and conspiracy theories, it is far from obvious that a government agency could be so much more advanced than the academic cutting-edge, especially in a hardware and technology-heavy field like quantum computing.\\n\\nThere is another option, though. Mathematicians are much easier to get hold of than quantum computers, and do not require any fancy technology to work (a computer, a stack of paper and a bin will suffice). Signals-intelligence agencies employ them by the hundreds. And although it is difficult at present to find the prime factors of big numbers, no one has actually formally proved that it has to be so. In other words, no one knows whether the present state of the art is the fastest way to do things. Quicker ways may well exist.\\n\\nIndeed, earlier in the year, there was some excitement in cryptographic circles when a pair of new papers reported the first significant progress in years in something called the \"discrete log',\n",

After the French had withdrawn, Syria has been in a constant state of civil war with one coup after another with factions constantly fighting, some even sponsored by the US. The regimes went through many different periods of dictatorship and democracy's constantly being replaced.\\n\\nIt was not until 1963 when The Arab Socialist Resurrection (Baath) Party (hereafter, Baath Party), with a secular, socialist, Arab nationalist orientation, took decisive control in a March 1963 coup. The Baath Party was active in throughout the middle East since the 1940's.\\n\\nIn 1970 a revolt occurred after many military failures a bloodless coup occurred and Hafez al-Assad, former Defense Lieutenant General, won the popular referendum and became president for the next 30 years.\\n\\nIn 1973 a constitution was established defining the roles of parliament, the president and vice president, the cabinet of ministers, and the people. It began by declaring Syria under a single party system that party being the Baath party, Islamic Jurisprudence was also established based on Shia law, the president is also required to be a follower of Islam. However, it also allowed for freedom of religion so long as public order is not threatened, this would later be used primarily on Sunni Arabs and Jews in Syria.

Parliament did not elect any opposition to run against Assad.\\n\\nAssad was met with pushback. A few years later Assad began reforming by enforcing/enacting mandatory retirement and replacing certain high-level administrators with appointments from outside the Baath Party. This effectively kicked many of the old out of the government who opposed his rule.\\n\\nIn 2011 many rebellion groups began to pop up and a few years later a civil war broke out.\\n\\nIn 2012 the Syrian Constitution was amended again transforming Syria into a multi-party democracy like much of the West.\\n\\nIs Syria a Dictatorship - Section based off of The current Syrian Constitution\\n\\nIt can be for 3 months. Syria follows a parliamentary system. In this system The Citizens of Syria elect members of parliament who then proceed to nominate one or more candidates for the presidency. The president then appoints a cabinet who have to be confirmed by parliament, the same way in the US.\\n\\nThe president more or less has power over most things aside from the law, which he is tasked to enforce. When parliament is out of session the president gains power over the law, however when parliament is back in session their first order of business is to scrutinize any laws made with the ability to throw them out in their entirety.\\n\\nThe president can also abolish parliament for up to 3 months, however a reason is needed and parliament can never be abolished twice for the same reason.\\n\\nThe president also has veto power, when parliament passes a bill the president can veto it, in which case it goes back to parliament where if it passes again with a super majority it will become law.\\n\\nSo in short, kind of. The president can gain absolute power at times and the system is flimsy without much oversight that I could find of the president itself. I'll put it this way if the US is a Demo-Republic then Syria is an Oligarch-Democracy.\\n\\nAlso worth noting in the 2012 referendum the presidency was limited to two 7 year terms. Meaning that if they wish to prove any semblance of non-dictatorial rule that this should legally be Assads last term ending in 2021. One more thing, a state of emergency had been in place for over 30 years allowing governments to seize those that speak out openly against the government. Assad lifted this state of emergency in hopes of avoiding a civil war.\\n\\nPersonal Thoughts\\n\\nThe Syrian regime, under the founding Baath party, seemed to show a great deal of French influence with their political breakdown/separation of power, religious liberty, and the government giving to the people. These were not commonly found during that period with many still being under Shariah or totalitarian regimes.\\n\\nNot to say this is not a totalitarian regime. Syria had been in a State of Emergency for over 30 years now\",\n",
       " \"The issue of weather modification - or 'environmental modification' (ENMOD) - has been coming back to my attention recently. In the past I have discussed the usually theories around HAARP etc, and even touched on chemtrails, yet with so much talk on global climate change and carbon emissions, with little or no mention of geo-engineering of climate, I again wonder... In the intervening years I have taken a consideration that the sun - our Solar Ra - has much to do with earth changes in our solar vicinity as well as on Earth, and have been looking into solar flares. No doubt more on this later. First, just a teaser - I came across this intriguing reference to the St. Louis Arch, a 636 ft. monument on the west bank of the Mississippi River, which has stood for nearly forty years. This short article titled ' Can We Control the Weather? ' says that\\nIt is a shining monument built to convey St. Louis's role as the Gateway to the West. Only now has the reason for its construction as well as its true purpose been revealed. It seems that some of the same scientists responsible for the doomsday weapon research in the deserts of the Southwest U.S. during the forties, were also interested in controlling the weather. They hoped to use weather control as a means to aid in troop movement and logistics for the Allies, as well as use it as a tactical weapon against the enemy. This, they hoped, would bring about a quick end to the war in Europe.\\nThus, the design for the arch was conceived. The stainless steel structure, while able to produce an ionic pulse, is impervious to any lingering affects. Each leg of the arch is able to push positive and negative ions into the air so as to create a positive or negatively charged field that can 'push' storms out of the way. During the day this national monument stands as the gateway to the west, but after hours this man-made marvel turns into one of the most powerful weather controlling devices ever conceived.\\nIt makes us wonder about some of the other modern architectural feats being erected around the world... -\",\n",
       " 'The Devil\\'s Evolution Catalog Chapter 45: The Arrogance of a Demon Child\\n\\nAs the two spiked maces hurtled towards him, he jumped backwards, perfectly dodging them. With a quick kick of his two feet, he sprinted towards No.3 and Big 4.\\n\\nBefore the pair could even recover from their missed swings, Chipped Horn was already within striking distance of No.3. With a forceful clench of his fist, the incandescent flames wrapped around his fists once more.\\n\\n*Bam*\\n\\nBefore No.3 could even react, the flaming fist slammed into his chest and sent his entire body careening through the air.\\n\\nNext to him, Big 4 was able to recover his stance with the time bought by No.3. As No.3 was sent flying, he counter attacked with his spiked mace.\\n\\nHowever, this attack was immediately stopped by the steel-like palms of the Demon Child, who with a clench of his fist, immediately took control of the incoming mace. With a violent tug, the mace left the hands of Big 4 and was immediately tossed away by Chipped Horn. With a fiery punch to his body, Big 4 was sent flying as well, his injuries just as severe as No.3. The pair would probably be unable to get up for a while.\\n\\nIn the short span of time it took for him to defeat No.3 and Big 4, I wasn\\'t idling about either. As the familiar flames extended from my hands, I prepared my sneak attack.\\n\\nFlame Whip!\\n\\nThe snake-like whip coiled around the left leg of Chipped Horn without much trouble. As the flames crackled, my heart fell. His leg was unharmed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s useless. Flames cannot harm me.\" With a light kick of his foot, the flames binding it dispersed harmlessly into the air.\\n\\nI was aware of his flame resistance, but this was the only option I had.\\n\\n\\nThe darkness arrows were simply too weak. It was still effective against large imps, but against head imps, its effects were significantly weaker. The enemy in front was even stronger than a head imp, so casting them was merely a waste of mana.\\n\\nMy nether flames were still sealed up, so I couldn\\'t use them. As for the bone wall...he was already able to break through them when he was a head imp. That means only my flame whip had any chance of working. No matter how slim those chances were, I still wanted to take the gamble.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that gamble failed miserably. As expected, he was immune to my flames.\\n\\n\"Err...let\\'s sit down and talk, there\\'s no need for all this violence.\"\\n\\n\"I want you!\"\\n\\nChipped Horn wasn\\'t in the mood to waste anymore time. He glared at me for a moment before instantly pouncing towards me.\\n\\nDamn it, don\\'t just jump straight into action after saying so!\\n\\nBone Wall!\\n\\nIn this crucial moment, I ended up relying on my bone wall after all. Even though I knew it was useless, I still struggled.\\n\\nThe creamy white wall immediately rose up from the ground, blocking the path between me and Chipped Horn. He wasn\\'t able to react to the sudden obstacle in front of him and rammed headlong into it.\\n\\n*crash*\\n\\nThe tank-like demon child rammed right through the bones as if they were merely paper. With that, the bone wall crumbled into a pile of broken shards. This was soon followed by the sound of a second bone wall being destroyed, and then a third...However, at this moment my eyes flickered to his feet, and a bone wall instantly rose at the point where his foot was about to land.\\n\\nMy plan was to trip him with my bone wall as he landed. The unexpected landfall would cause him to lose his balance and fall. Unfortunately for me, having evolved into a demon child, Chipped Horn seemed to have gained inhuman reflexes as well.\\n\\nThe moment he noticed the bone wall, he shifted his weight towards the front, regaining his balance. With a light kick of his feet, he made a tiny leap off the rising wall, as if it were stepping stone.\\n\\nWhile he wasted time on this tiny wall, I prepared a 4th bone wall in his path. If everything went according to plan, he wouldn\\'t be able to change his course midair and would crash right into that wall.\\n\\nHowever, tactics were meaningless in front of such immense strength. Even with my mana strengthening this wall, the outcome was still as bleak as the other three.\\n\\nWhile he wasn\\'t able to change course as expected, he instead clasped his hands together and raised them up high. His muscles bulged as he brought them down onto the wall',\n",

       " 'by Paul Kay and Luisa Maffi cite\\n\\n1. The World Color Survey\\n\\nThe following four maps (132A, 133A, 134A, 135A) show the distribution of colour terms in some of the world\\'s languages, based on the World Color Survey. This project, a collaboration of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), collected colour-naming data from 110 languages being studied by SIL linguist-translators in the late 1970s. For further details on methods and results of the World Color Survey see Kay et al. (1991), Kay and Berlin (1997), Kay et al. (1997), Hardin and Maffi (1997), Kay and Maffi (1999).\\n\\n2. Basic colour term concepts\\n\\nIn recent models of the universals and evolution theory of basic colour terms, stemming originally from Berlin and Kay (1969), three kinds of universal colour categories are recognized (Kay and McDaniel 1978, Kay et al. 1991, Kay et al. 1997, Kay and Maffi 1999): primary colour categories, composite (disjunctive) colour categories, and derived (intersective) colour categories.\\n\\nFirst, there are the six primary colours recognized in the widely accepted theory of colour opponency (Hering 1964 [1920], Jameson and Hurvich 1968; Hurvich 1982):\\n\\nBlack\\n\\nWhite\\n\\nRed\\n\\nYellow\\n\\nGreen\\n\\nBlue\\n\\nThese are the two pairs of fundamental opponent chromatic colours <Red, Green> and <Yellow, Blue> and the single pair of fundamental achromatic colours <Black, White>. Black and white are not opposed in the same sense as the chromatic pairs. For example, we can see a combination of black and white (gray) but there is no sensation consisting of the combination of red and green or of blue and yellow. (That blue and yellow pigments can be mixed to produce a green pigment is not relevant; there are no bluish yellow or yellowish blue sensations.)\\n\\nWe will refer to the six colours black, white, red, yellow, green and blue as primaries.\\n\\nSecondly, there are composite categories consisting of fuzzy unions of the primaries. (Colour categories are modeled as fuzzy sets, that is, sets whose membership is a matter of more or less. For non-technical discussion of fuzzy sets, fuzzy intersection, fuzzy union, and related concepts in relation to colour categories, see Kay and McDaniel (1978); for technical discussion of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, see Zadeh (1996).)\\n\\nBy far the most widespread composite in the ethnographic present is green-or-blue or \"grue\" (see Map 134A). Over half the languages in the World Color Survey contain a grue term. Other major composite terms documented in the World Color Survey are, using \"/\" for fuzzy union, Black/Green/Blue, White/Red/Yellow, Black/Blue, Red/Yellow, Yellow/Green/Blue, and Yellow/Green. (There is one, somewhat unclear, instance of a probable White/Yellow term in Waorani, an isolate of Ecuador.)\\n\\nThere are also what we might call minor composites. For example, in systems that lack terms for purple and brown, these colours are often included in the black term. Similarly, in systems restricted to the primaries, non-primary shades such as brown, purple, pink, orange and gray are characteristically either split between two adjacent primaries or covered by a single adjacent primary.\\n\\nThe third type of widespread colour category are the derived (intersective) categories, which are experienced as mixtures of the primaries. These are based formally on fuzzy intersections of primaries. Gray is experienced as a mixture of Black and White, pink of White and Red, orange of Yellow and Red, purple of Blue and Red, and brown (arguably) of Yellow and Black.\\n\\n3. An evolutionary sequence of basic colour systems\\n\\nFigure 1 presents both a typology and an evolutionary sequence of basic colour systems covering 101 of the 110 World Color Survey languages. (The colour lexicons of the remaining nine languages are composed mostly of terms denoting categories appearing in Figure 1. Limits of space preclude further discussion here; see Kay and Maffi 1999.)\\n\\nBasic colour lexicon types are shown in square brackets and evolutionary stages are represented by columns, labeled with Roman numerals. For example, stage I contains a single type, consisting of two terms, one a composite of White, Red and Yellow and the other a composite of Black, Green, and Blue. (There are no stage I languages in the World Color Survey sample. Stage I is shown here for theoretical completeness.)\\n\\nArrows indicate observed evolutionary transitions between types. Arabic numerals within brackets indicate the number of World Color Survey languages conforming to the corresponding colour lexicon type. Arabic numerals placed between basic colour lex',\n",

       " 'Seven Myths About the Iraq War: How BBC Newsnight failed journalism on the 10 year anniversary of the invasion\\n\\nby Nafeez Ahmed\\n\\nAs a participant in BBC Newsnight special, \"Iraq – 10 Years On\", I found myself feeling slightly miffed at the lack of real debate on the crucial issues.\\n\\nOn the one hand, Newsnight presented a number of narratives of the war and its aftermath as \\'fact\\', which are deeply questionable. On the other, there were no serious, factually-grounded criticisms of the war, despite a diverse panel which included people who did not support it.\\n\\nAs author of a major book on the war and its historical context, Behind the War on Terror: Western Secret Strategy and the Struggle for Iraq, as well as co-author of a new report, Executive Decisions: How British Intelligence was Hijacked for the Iraq War, I consider myself to be reasonably informed. Yet BBC Newsnight failed almost entirely to bring any of these issues to light.\\n\\nWhat follows is my Newsnight-inspired Iraq War Myth-Busting exercise, based on what was, and wasn\\'t, discussed on the show.\\n\\nMYTH 1. Sectarian violence has increased in postwar Iraq because sectarianism has always existed in Iraq, and the removal of Saddam allowed it to erupt\\n\\nOne of the first Newsnight bloopers started with a short introductory clip from John Simpson, the BBC\\'s World Affairs Editor. Amongst other things, Simpson talked about the rise of sectarian Sunni-Shi\\'a violence in postwar Iraq, and argued that while Saddam\\'s regime had clamped down on sectarian divisions, regime change effectively unleashed those previously suppressed divisions and allowed them to worsen.\\n\\nThis was the first of many oversimplifications about the escalation of sectarian violence in Iraq. The reality, as pointed out on the show by my colleague in the audience, anthropologist Professor Nadje al-Ali, is that prior to the war, generic sectarian antagonism was unheard of in Iraqi society. Although Saddam\\'s regime was unequivocally sectarian in its own violence against Shi\\'as and Kurds, as a mechanism of shoring up the Ba\\'athist regime, Iraqis did not largely identify in sectarian terms. As one Iraqi blogger living in Baghdad noted:\\n\\n\"I always hear the Iraqi pro-war crowd interviewed on television from foreign capitals (they can only appear on television from the safety of foreign capitals because I defy anyone to be publicly pro-war in Iraq)… They go on and on about Iraq\\'s history and how Sunnis and Shia were always in conflict and I hate that. I hate that a handful of expats who haven\\'t been to the country in decades pretend to know more about it than people actually living there. I remember Baghdad before the war- one could live anywhere. We didn\\'t know what our neighbors were- we didn\\'t care. No one asked about religion or sect. No one bothered with what was considered a trivial topic: are you Sunni or Shia? You only asked something like that if you were uncouth and backward. Our lives revolve around it now. Our existence depends on hiding it or highlighting it- depending on the group of masked men who stop you or raid your home in the middle of the night.\"\\n\\nMissing from the BBC Newsnight discussion was the fact that the Bush administration planned from the outset to dominate Iraq by pursuing the de facto ethnic partition of the country into three autonomous cantons. The private US intelligence firm, Stratfor, reported that the US was \"working on a plan to merge Iraq and Jordan into a unitary kingdom to be ruled by the Hashemite dynasty headed by King Abdullah of Jordan.\" The plan was \"authored by US Vice President Dick Cheney\" as well as \"Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz\", and was first discussed at \"an unusual meeting between Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and pro-US Iraqi Sunni opposition members in London in July\" 2002.\\n\\nUnder this plan, the central and largest part of Iraq populated largely by Sunnis would be joined with Jordan, and would include Baghdad, which would no longer be the capital. The Kurdish region of northern and northwestern Iraq, including Mosul and the vast Kirkuk oilfields, would become its own autonomous state.

Students in his graduate virtual reality course — from both the Jonsson School and the School of Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication — created three distinct virtual environment prototypes for MyndVR\\'s target audience. They include a nightclub complete with a live singer, an immersive sudoku game set above a koi pond, and a set of serene day and night environments ranging from mountains, lakes and beaches to the Taj Mahal.\\n\\nThree Tiers of Content\\n\\nChris Brickler, co-founder and CEO of MyndVR, said his company\\'s initial intention was to focus on a broad-spectrum, quality-of-life approach across a network of more than 50 long-term care and retirement facilities.\\n\\n\"Our product road map envisions three tiers of content,\" Brickler said. \"The first layer is recreational content — going to the Great Wall, swimming with dolphins and the like. Next would be therapeutic content — music, nature and brain exercises.\\n\\n\"The top level, the uncharted water, is prescriptive digital therapy. MyndVR\\'s goal is to provide virtual reality content customized to a user\\'s diagnosis. That\\'s why we\\'re so excited about working with UTD on not only the development of the VR, but also the cognitive implications.\"\\n\\nFor many students in McMahan\\'s VR class, the MyndVR project was their first experience with an external stakeholder.\\n\\nUT Dallas graduate student Ariel Comstock and assistant professor Dr. Ryan McMahan (right) are playing key roles in the work of MyndVR co-founder and CEO Chris Brickler (left). Comstock coordinated four MyndVR trials at facilities around the country, and students in McMahan\\'s VR class created content for the company\\'s target audience.\\n\\n\"Our partnership with MyndVR gave my students experience with a real company and real objectives,\" he said. \"That collaboration was successful enough that MyndVR recruited one of those students as their first employee. She coordinated four MyndVR trials at facilities around the country.\"\\n\\nThat employee — Ariel Comstock, a master\\'s of fine arts student in ATEC — emphasized the role the VR experience can play in empowering MyndVR\\'s audience.\\n\\n\"MyndVR transports a viewer mentally away for the duration of the experience, and they finish feeling like they went somewhere,\" Comstock said. \"For people who are not as agile as they once were, it can give them a sense of confidence, of agency — they choose where they want to go, and then go there.\"\\n\\nIn conducting MyndVR\\'s trials in Kansas, Florida, California and Texas — working with more than 250 seniors from ages 70 to 100 — Comstock has seen the extreme emotions that these programs can evoke.\\n\\n\"I see wonder, awe and elation, but sometimes tears and sadness too,\" Comstock said. \"I\\'ve also seen immersion to the extent that a senior who was experiencing \\'MyMusic\\' — the 1950s nightclub — threw up her hands and sang along with \\'New York, New York,\\' waving her arms as if she were performing herself.\"\\n\\nBrian Barnes, CFO/COO of The Legacy Senior Communities, observed similar effects during the trial at Willow Bend, a continuing care retirement community in Plano.\\n\\n\"The MyndVR trial demonstrated a variety of benefits,\" Barnes said. \"In one case, a resident living with Alzheimer\\'s exhibited personality traits she had prior to the diagnosis, including dancing, smiling and singing. Another resident felt relief from symptoms of Parkinson\\'s. The overall response has impressed everyone involved.\"\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'A bill to create an athletic commission in South Dakota is going nowhere fast, largely thanks to the ignorance of Gov. Dennis Daugaard and state house Rep. Steve Hickey.\\n\\nTheir primary objective is to ban sanctioned mixed martial arts in the state. In a blog post, Hickey writes that, \"MMA Cage Fighting is the child porn of sports.\"\\n\\nThe lack of knowledge and the lack of research both Daugaard and Hickey showed about MMA has to be frightening for persons who live in South Dakota. If they can\\'t be bothered to do the minimal research required to learn that MMA is far safer than other \"mainstream\" sports, including football, it\\'s scary to think about the laws they\\'ll pass in the state regarding education, health care and budgets.\\n\\nThe UFC is the largest MMA promoter in the world. No fighter has ever suffered traumatic brain injury, let alone died, in the UFC\\'s 20-year history. A 2006 study done by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and which appeared in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine found MMA has far less traumatic brain injury than other sports.\\n\\nMixed Martial Arts competitions have changed dramatically since the first Ultimate Fighting Championship in 1993. The overall injury rate in MMA competitions is now similar to other combat sports, including boxing. Knockout rates are lower in MMA competitions than in boxing. This suggests a reduced risk of TBI [traumatic brain injury] in MMA competitions when compared to other events involving striking. MMA events must continue to be properly supervised by trained referees and ringside physicians, and the rules implemented by state sanctioning—including weight classes, limited rounds per match, proper safety gear, and banning of the most devastating attacks– must be strictly enforced. Further research is necessary to continue to improve safety in this developing new sport.\\n\\nA 2008 study released by the British Journal of Sports Medicine reached the same conclusions. After a five-year study, its authors wrote:\\n\\nInjury rates in regulated professional MMA competition are similar to other combat sports; the overall risk of critical sports-related injury appears low. Additional study is warranted to achieve a better understanding of injury trends and ways to further lower injury risk in MMA.\\n\\nThe simple fact is that a random NFL player is at far greater risk of a serious brain injury than is a random MMA fighter. Sadly, neither Gov. Daugaard nor Rep. Hickey bothered to do much investigation or educate themselves before speaking out.\\n\\nSouth Dakota state house Rep. Mark Johnston introduced a bill to create an athletic commission in the state for the express purpose of making the sport safer. According to the Argus Leader, Johnston said his goal is to prevent unregulated events where tragedies could possibly occur.\\n\\nA state athletic commission\\'s job is, at the core, to protect the fighters. It makes sure the proposed matches are fair and that promoters have doctors and an ambulance at all events. The commissions also require qualified referees, who stop fights when one fighter is in danger. It also requires fighters to undergo extensive medical examinations before fighting to make certain they are fit to compete. States such as Nevada, California and New York, with strong commissions, have discovered injuries fighters didn\\'t know they had and prevented them from competing. That wouldn\\'t be the case in South Dakota, with no commission to require those tests.\\n\\nStory Continues',\n",

That all changes on September 7 when a firmware update will add five of DJI's Intelligent Flight Modes to those models.\\n\\nThese modes include waypoint navigation, point of interest (POI) flight planning and a Follow Me function. Waypoint navigation lets you set up a multipoint path for the drone to follow while you control the camera angle, and paths can be saved so you can recreate the flight again and again.\\n\\nPOI flight planning allows you to set up an autonomous orbit around a subject at an altitude, distance and speed you select. The Phantom 3 will fly the path keeping the camera centered on your subject at all times.\\n\\nFollow Me uses the drone's transmitter and your phone or tablet to track your movements. This lets you use a Phantom 3 as a personal camera operator as it follows you at a fixed altitude and distance while you do whatever. Keep in mind, though, it won't avoid obstacles, so riding a bike trail through the woods probably won't end well.\\n\\nJoshua Goldman/CNET\\n\\nAlso available are Course and Home Lock modes. The former makes all flight controls relative to your current position. That means moving the controller's stick left, right, forward or back will always move the Phantom 3 in those directions, regardless of where the camera is pointing.\\n\\nSimilarly, enabling the Home Lock mode will make the orientation relative to yourself as the home point. This is helpful if you've flown beyond line of sight and want to return home but can't determine the orientation.\\n\\nPhantom 3 Advanced owners get a bonus, too: The firmware upgrade will add 2.7K (2,704x1,520-pixel) resolution movie capture at 30 frames per second.\\n\\nLastly, a firmware update will also be available for the professional-level Inspire 1 that will add all of these Intelligent Flight Modes except for Follow Me.\\n\\nCatch all the electronics news from this week's show in Berlin.\",\n",

Mr.R was the standout competitor from the field. The Sheik main used Cloud in the grand finals against ZeRo and was one scramble decision away from taking down the entire tournament.

       " 'Who are the Inuits?\\n\\nWho are the Inuits ?\\n\\nThe Inuit are the aboriginal inhabitants of the North American Arctic, from Bering Strait to East Greenland, a distance of over 6000 kilometres. As well as Arctic Canada, Inuit also live in northern Alaska and Greenland, and have close relatives in Russia. They are united by a common cultural heritage and a common language. Until recently, outsiders called the Inuit \"Eskimo.\" Now they prefer their own term, \"Inuit,\" meaning simply \"people.\" There are about 40,000 Inuit in Canada.\\n\\nInuit Origins\\n\\nAccording to archaeological research, the origins of the Inuit lie in north-western Alaska. These first Alaskan Inuit lived on the seacoast and tundra, where they hunted seals, walrus, whales, and caribou. They lived in houses made of driftwood and sod, and almost certainly spoke an early version of the Inuit language, Inuktitut. They and their ancestors were the first Arctic people to become expert at hunting the larger sea mammals, such as the bowhead whale. The large volume of food that resulted from a successful hunt—even a small whale could weigh seven tonnes-meant that their way of life was richer and more secure than that of many other hunting people.\\n\\nThe Inuit Move East\\n\\nBeginning about a thousand years ago, these early Inuit began to spread east into Arctic Canada. Within a few hundred years, they had replaced the earlier inhabitants of the region, a now-extinct people known to the Inuit as Tunit. This Inuit migration was not a single mass event, but probably involved dozens of small parties of perhaps 20 or 30 people moving east in search of a better life.\\n\\nA particular goal seems to have been the rich whaling grounds around Baffin and Somerset islands. Here they quickly replicated the large whaling villages and prosperous way of life they had left behind in Alaska. Other groups settled in coastal areas without rich whale resources, where they lived in smaller villages and depended primarily upon seals, caribou and fish. Everywhere they went, Inuit pioneers brought with them the heavy sod winter houses and elaborate hunting technology of their Alaskan ancestors.\\n\\nThe Inuit and the Vikings\\n\\nBy about AD1250, the first Inuit had entered Greenland through the Smith Sound area in the far northwest of the island. Here, possibly on the Canadian side, they first encountered medieval Norse (\"Viking\") hunters coming from the Norse colonies in southwest Greenland founded by Eric the Red. Eventually these Norse colonies disappeared, probably in the mid 1400s. There are different theories about their disappearance, but a deteriorating climate was one reason. Competition with the Inuit, who were far better adapted to Arctic life than the Norse, might also have been a factor. By the time of later European exploration in the 16th century, the Inuit were in sole possession of the entire North American Arctic.\\n\\nA Colder Climate\\n\\nThe same worsening climate that spelled the end of the Norse colonies in Greenland also put severe strains on the Inuit economy. After about 1300, temperatures became progressively colder culminating in a so-called Little Ice Age around 1500. Rich and important whaling areas in the High Arctic were abandoned and people shifted southward.\\n\\nBowhead whaling as the focus of Inuit life disappeared from most of Canada and Greenland (although not Alaska). Life generally became harder and more hand-to-mouth. People moved their camps and villages more frequently, and, in many areas, the old sod and whalebone winter house was abandoned in favour of houses made of blocks of snow. They were easier to build as they could be put up anywhere, even on the sea ice, and required only an hour or two to construct.\\n\\nContact with Explorers\\n\\nContact with European explorers also brought changes. Between the voyages of Martin Frobisher in the 1570s and the search for the missing Franklin expedition in the 1850s, dozens of expeditions to the Arctic set sail, usually from England. Most of them were in search of a Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\\n\\nAt first, Europeans did not see the Arctic as a place of value in itself, but as an obstacle blocking their way to the fortunes beyond. During their journeys through the North, European explorers often met Inuit. Few Europeans were unprejudiced enough to think they had anything to learn from the Inuit, but they did trade and exchange gifts. The Inuit began to learn about the outside world and to appreciate what it had to offer. The Europeans brought them iron, which they valued for making tools such as harpoon points and knife blades.\\n\\nThe Whalers\\n\\nIn the 1850s, Europeans and Americans began to appreciate the commercial value of the Arctic\\'s animal resources. The North Atlantic commercial whaling industry, operating out of Britain and New England, began large-scale operations in what are',\n",

       " '(Justin Sullivan/Getty)\\n\\nWhy should a union representing workers who are not employees of McDonald\\'s be empowered to squeeze concessions out of McDonald\\'s? Why did Willie Sutton rob banks?\\n\\nIn a party-line decision, the Democrat-dominated National Labor Relations Board has decided that employees of contractors can be treated as employees of other companies when . . . well, when it is convenient for Democratic constituencies that they be so treated. The underlying case involved an operator of recycling centers, Browning-Ferris Industries of California, which uses subcontractors to staff some of its facilities. Firms have many reasons for using subcontracted labor, one of which is avoiding entanglement with the NLRB. Tut-tut, say the feds.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut in the more relevant cases, contracting is built into the business model, as it is with franchise restaurants and similar businesses, which are what this case really is about. Most people who work for McDonald\\'s do not actually work for McDonald\\'s Corporation, which operates only a small number of the burger joints bearing its name. The overwhelming majority of McDonald\\'s restaurants are franchises, independent businesses ranging from one-shop outfits to very large operations, the owners of which pay a fee to McDonald\\'s for the use of its name, business model, and supply chain. Your local fry-guy was not hired by McDonald\\'s, cannot be fired by McDonald\\'s, is not paid by McDonald\\'s, and is not supervised by McDonald\\'s. His terms of employment are not set by McDonald\\'s but by his employer, the franchise operator. He is not an employee of McDonald\\'s in any meaningful sense, but the Democrats on the NLRB are not interested in sense — they are interested in power.\\n\\nUnion membership, particularly in the private sector, has been declining for decades. There are fewer than 8 million private-sector workers in unions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By way of comparison, there already are more than 2 million American workers employed in the so-called gig economy, working mainly as private contractors and individual entrepreneurs through firms such as Uber and AirBnB. It is very likely that within a few years there will be more Lyft drivers than Teamsters.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Get Free Exclusive NR Content\\n\\nThe political fallout of declining union membership presents a mortal threat to the Left\\'s operating coalition. It\\'s not just because of the money-laundering that converts union dues into Democratic campaign contributions, though that\\'s not nothing; rather, it is that if fewer firms and economic sectors are under political discipline, then the value of being the party of government declines. When fewer firms are covered by, say, NLRB rules, then the political premium attached to being the rule-maker is diminished. Thus, the Left is scrambling to keep unionized firms under the federal thumb — consider the NLRB\\'s improper attack on Boeing — while laboring to open up new avenues of union membership. Illinois insisted that privately employed home-health-care workers were \"public employees\" required to pay dues to the SEIU simply because their clients were Medicare recipients, a risible claim rightly thrown out by the Supreme Court (5–4, of course; liberal jurists are liberals first, jurists second if at all).\\n\\nThe NLRB\\'s ruling empowers the federal government to designate companies as \"joint employers\" on the flimsiest of grounds. For example, a corporation that requires all its franchisee owners to use the same scheduling software could be considered a joint employer for that reason alone.\\n\\nThis is about enabling labor activists to exercise power over large businesses that are, for the moment, largely beyond their grasp.\\n\\nThe NLRB and labor activists say that this ruling is necessary because in recent decades practices such as subcontracting and franchising have allowed many businesses to insulate themselves from direct NLRB oversight. This is true, and in many cases the avoidance of federal micromanagement almost certainly was an animating force. If the NLRB expects that businesses will sit still after this ruling, it is engaged in self-delusion: One of the few reliable effects of centralized regulation is that businesses will invest, and sometimes invest heavily, in regulation avoidance.\\n\\nThere is probably no set of sustainable economic arrangements that will allow a single-parent fast-food employee to raise two children in the same comfort and security that might be provided by, say, a couple of married professionals. But the employees are incidental: This is about enabling labor activists to exercise power over large businesses that are, for the moment, largely beyond their grasp. Congress, happily, has the power to set aside this implausible overreach, which is exactly what it should do.',\n",

       " 'During a sophomore season that saw Tyler Seguin come up a goal shy of 30 and three points shy of 70, he finally turned 20. He had become a Stanley Cup champion the year before, in 2011, and seemed on the verge of making the leap from good to great.\\n\\nWhen that didn\\'t happen the following season - he put up 32 points in 48 games, followed by an uninspiring eight points in 22 playoff games - the Bruins sent him packing to Dallas. This is what\\'s known in hockey circles as an \"organizational oopsie.\"\\n\\nFast forward a year, and I feel comfortable floating out a few questions: could Tyler Seguin lead the NHL in scoring one season? If so, how soon? Could it be this season?\\n\\nYou likely noticed that the young center had a nice year with Dallas, but \"nice year\" doesn\\'t really do it justice. He finished alone in fourth in the NHL with 84 points, and helped make up one of the most dynamic duos in hockey alongside Jamie Benn. He took 294 shots (fourth-most in the league), leading to 37 goals on a wholly sustainable 12.6% shooting percentage (sustainable for an elite shooter like Seguin, that is). He got a step faster and noticeably stronger; it wasn\\'t luck.\\n\\nHis possession stats were also shiny, for those so inclined. He saw a 52.3% share of the shot attempts while he was on the ice, and pushed that to 61.8% in playoffs - a time when he undeniably would have been the focal point of the opposition. Pushing through and improving on his already great regular season performance implies he\\'s a player with the drive the Bruins implied he wasn\\'t.\\n\\nSeguin is going to have even more help this season. Occupying the spot largely filled by Rich Peverley and then-rookie Valeri Nichushkin last season will likely be Ales Hemsky, a skilled disher whose likely to maximize the output of two pure shooters.\\n\\nBenn himself will be 25 and fully into his scoring prime while coming off a season that saw him represent Team Canada and set career highs in [fill in a category of your choice]. That won\\'t hurt much, nor will Dallas having some young D-men that look poised to take a step in the right direction.\\n\\nStatistics show that elite scorers peak earlier than most fans think, but that tends to mean somewhere around 24-25, not 27-28.\\n\\nAt 22, Seguin is just on the verge of sliding into his prime - a crazy concept for a guy who just finished with more points than names like Alex Ovechkin, Corey Perry and Jonathan Toews.\\n\\nClearing the obvious hurdle\\n\\nOh, right. Reigning \"World\\'s Best Hockey Human\" Sidney Crosby still exists. That\\'s a bit more than a speed bump.\\n\\nI\\'m not naive enough to believe that Seguin is going to suddenly make up the 20 points Crosby beat him by this past season, but there are some reasons to believe he could substantially close that gap, and hope for a little luck.\\n\\nFor starters, Crosby\\'s linemates are only getting older, which means they ain\\'t getting better - and might be getting worse.\\n\\nChris Kunitz will be 35 this year, which is well into the years of statistical decline for scorers. Kunitz was above a point per game in the lockout shortened year, and he was 10 points under it last season; his fall-off might be underway as we speak. Pascal Dupuis is 35 with a huge career games played total as a guy who\\'s only topped 50 points once.\\n\\nUnless Sid is tied to Evgeni Malkin he won\\'t have a ton of help, and if the Pens hope to present themselves as a team with real depth, they\\'re probably best keeping their two elite centers separated.\\n\\nThe other factor here, is that Crosby\\'s had some well publicized injury trouble in his career. You hope it never befalls Sid again, but Seguin has only missed 11 career games over four NHL seasons. If the Pens captain runs into any more trouble, the league leaders list will be there for the taking - and ol\\' Ty-Ty has proven pretty durable.\\n\\nObviously Seguin wouldn\\'t be alone in the chase for the Art Ross. Taylor Hall is at an almost identical place in his career, though playing on a worse team probably makes topping the league scorers list harder (as does his more reckless style, in terms of games played). Malkin and Patrick Kane both missed substantial playing time last year, with the former being a legit threat for the league\\'s top spot when healthy. If Claude Giroux gets off to anything other than an atrocious start like last year, he showed he can be better than a point-per-game guy.\\n\\nBut there\\'s little doubt that Seguin now warrants mention with the guys listed',\n",

       " \"The narrow Kerch Strait, which ranges from 4.5 to 15 kilometres wide and connects the Black Sea and the Azov Sea, is known as a convenient place for offshore ship-to-ship transshipment. Every year more than 15 million tons of cargo – predominantly oil, grains and fertilisers – are processed through the anchorage areas in the strait. More than 95% of this volume comprises Russian-origin commodities shipped from ports on the Volga and Don Rivers and the Caspian Basin by coaster ships, which is then transshipped onto large ocean-going vessels.\\n\\nTransshipment in the Kerch Strait has faced a number of natural, political and legal issues over the years. The relatively shallow waters of the strait do not allow for safe passage of Panamax and Capesize vessels when fully laden. Moreover, a tangle of legal conflicts and loopholes has turned the strait into a 'grey zone', with the biggest problem being the strait's lack of clear legal status.\\n\\nIn accordance with Article 15 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, where the coasts of two states are opposite or adjacent to one another, neither state is entitled (failing agreement between them to the contrary) to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of both states' territorial seas are measured. This provision does not apply where it is necessary, by reason of historic title or other special circumstances, to delimit the territorial seas of the two states in a way that is at odds with the convention.\\n\\nThe Kerch Strait is a special case, as it is impossible to delimit the territorial waters at the median line. Therefore, the status of the strait has been determined by special agreements between Ukraine and Russia. The Treaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on Cooperation in the Use of the Azov Sea and Kerch Strait stipulates that the \\u200b\\u200bAzov Sea and the Kerch Strait have historically been the internal waters of both Ukraine and Russia, and that the settlement of all issues related to the Kerch Strait is to be carried out by agreement between the two countries. The border between Ukraine and Russia has not yet been officially demarcated.\\n\\nIn practice, this means that neither Ukraine nor Russia has full jurisdiction and control over the strait. This lacuna has led to the development of ship-to-ship transshipment and bunkering on anchorage places in the strait. Some of these anchorage areas are located within the Ukrainian zone of responsibility, while others are in zones controlled by Russia.\\n\\nAlthough Ukrainian authorities have control over anchorages in respect of vessel traffic and navigational safety, they do not have territorial jurisdiction over the areas defined as 'transit anchorage places'. Anchorage areas are not included in the water areas of Ukrainian ports, so no state control procedures govern them. These anchorage areas are not a part of Ukrainian customs or state territory. Thus, technically all operations are arranged outside Ukrainian borders.\\n\\nThe obvious advantage for shipowners and cargo shippers is that transshipment and bunkering operations are undertaken under a 'transit' regime, thus avoiding customs clearance, border control and other types of government surveillance. This also allows for bunkering and transshipment without formally calling the vessels at port – therefore avoiding both payment of port charges and the need to obtain free practice for vessels.\\n\\nHowever, the Ukrainian authorities have recently attempted to take control over transshipment on transit anchorages. In June 2013 the Cabinet of Ministers passed a decree that the anchorage areas within the Ukrainian zone of responsibility be included in the official water area of the port of Kerch. In view of international law and the bilateral treaties between Ukraine and Russia, the validity of this decree may be dubious.\\n\\nFollowing the decree, the State Customs Service required that thorough customs control be exerted over all transshipment operations undertaken by vessels in anchorage areas. The customs authorities insist that the anchorage areas in the Kerch Strait fall within Ukrainian customs territory. However, considering the legal status of the strait as the 'internal waters of Ukraine and Russia', and in the absence of demarcated borders in the strait, this requirement is questionable in terms of territorial jurisdiction. Despite the fact that there are neither legal grounds nor effective fulfilment mechanisms for this requirement, the authorities are likely to continue attempts to expand their jurisdiction over the anchorages. In practice, this implies the abolition of the existing transit regime and the loss of all incentives for ship-to-ship transshipment in Ukrainian anchorage areas.\\n\\nThe Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority recently initiated a series of lawsuits against shipping agents in an attempt to recover unpaid port charges for the vessels which operated in anchorage transshipment zones after the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers came into force. The reasoning given was that all anchorages fall within the remit of port waters, and are thus subject to port charges.\",\n",

       " 'Psychiatric service dogs are allowed in most public places, while emotional support animals are not.\\n\\nService dogs play an essential role in the lives of many individuals with disabilities. Federal law grants certain rights and protections to people with disabilities who use guide dogs or service dogs.\\n\\nAccess to Public Places and the ADA\\n\\nDifferent laws govern the use of service animals in different contexts. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) governs the use of service dogs in public places.\\n\\nThe ADA guarantees people with disabilities who use service dogs equal access to public places such as restaurants, hospitals, hotels, theaters, shops, and government buildings. This means that these places must allow service dogs, and the ADA requires them to modify their practices to accommodate the dogs, if necessary.\\n\\nHowever, these protections only apply to dogs that satisfy the ADA\\'s definition of \"service animal.\" The ADA defines a service animal as a dog that is \"individually trained\" to \"perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability.\" The tasks a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person\\'s disability.\\n\\nA \"helper monkey\" or a cat cannot be considered a service animal under the ADA; the ADA limits the definition of service animals to dogs. In some limited circumstances, the ADA provides that public places should also accomodate persons with disabilities who use miniature horses to perform tasks.\\n\\nThe best-known example of service dogs are guide dogs that help blind people navigate safely around obstacles. Service dogs can also be trained to assist deaf individuals, wheelchair-users and other people with mobility impairments, as well as people who have psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disabilities.\\n\\nPsychiatric Service Dogs\\n\\n\"Psychiatric service dogs\" are service dogs that provide assistance to people with psychiatric disabilities, such as severe depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\\n\\nExamples of work or tasks that psychiatric service dogs perform include:\\n\\nproviding safety checks or room searches for individuals with PTSD\\n\\nblocking persons in dissociative episodes from wandering into danger (for example, traffic), and\\n\\npreventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors, such as self-mutilation.\\n\\nEmotional Support Animals\\n\\nMany individuals—both with and without disabilities—derive emotional support and comfort from dogs and other animals that are not specially trained to perform specific tasks directly related to a psychiatric disability.\\n\\nThe ADA considers such \"emotional support animals\" to be distinct from psychiatric service dogs, and treats them differently. The ADA does not grant emotional support dog owners the same right of access to public places that it gives to individuals who use psychiatric service dogs. That means that under the ADA, a movie theater, for example, must allow psychiatric service dogs to accompany their owners into the movie auditorium but can refuse to admit individuals with emotional support dogs.\\n\\nThe Difference Between a Psychiatric Service Dog and an Emotional Support Dog\\n\\nIt is not always clear—to staff at public places, and even to some people with disabilities—whether an animal accompanying an individual with a psychiatric disability or impairment is performing a psychiatric service or \"merely\" providing emotional support. Confusion may result in unlawful and discriminatory treatment of people with disabilities.\\n\\nThe key distinction to remember is that a psychiatric service animal is actually trained to perform certain tasks that are directly related to an individual\\'s psychiatric disability. The dog\\'s primary role is not to provide emotional support. It is to assist the owner with the accomplishment of vital tasks they otherwise would not be able to perform independently. In addition, a psychiatric service dog must not only respond to an owner\\'s need for help, the dog must also be trained to recognize the need for help in the first place. A dog must be able to respond and recognize to be a service dog.\\n\\nBy contrast, an emotional support dog is a pet that is not trained to perform specific acts directly related to an individual\\'s psychiatric disability. Instead, the pet\\'s owner simply derives a sense of well-being, safety, or calm from the dog\\'s companionship and physical presence.\\n\\nThe animal companionship of an emotional support dog can have genuine therapeutic benefits for individuals with psychiatric disabilities and less severe mental impairments. But unless the dog is also trained to work—to independently recognize and respond to its owner\\'s psychiatric disability—the dog does not qualify as a psychiatric service dog and does not receive the protections of the ADA.\\n\\nFor example, people with social phobia might only feel safe enough to leave their home for food or medication if their dog accompanies them. Such a dog would be considered an emotional support animal.\\n\\nIf, however, the same person is prone to dissociative episodes when they leave home, and their dog is trained to recognize and respond to the onset of such an episode by nudging, barking, or removing the individual to a safe location, then the dog would be considered a psychiatric service dog.\\n\\nDifferent State Laws',\n",

Today, I want to discuss our plans to focus our talent and investments in areas where we have differentiation and potential for growth, as well as how we'll partner to drive better scale and results. In all we do, we will take a long-term view and build deep technical capability that allows us to innovate in the future.\\n\\nWith that context, I want to update you on decisions impacting our phone business and share more on last week's mapping and display advertising announcements.\\n\\nWe anticipate that these changes, in addition to other headcount alignment changes, will result in the reduction of up to 7,800 positions globally, primarily in our phone business. We expect that the reductions will take place over the next several months.\\n\\nI don't take changes in plans like these lightly, given that they affect the lives of people who have made an impact at Microsoft.

As a result, the company will take an impairment charge of approximately $7.6 billion related to assets associated with the acquisition of the Nokia Devices and Services business in addition to a restructuring charge of approximately $750 million to $850 million.\\n\\nI am committed to our first-party devices including phones. However, we need to focus our phone efforts in the near term while driving reinvention. We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem that includes our first-party device family.\\n\\nIn the near term, we will run a more effective phone portfolio, with better products and speed to market given the recently formed Windows and Devices Group. We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software. We'll bring business customers the best management, security and productivity experiences they need; value phone buyers the communications services they want; and Windows fans the flagship devices they'll love.\\n\\nIn the longer term, Microsoft devices will spark innovation, create new categories and generate opportunity for the Windows ecosystem more broadly. Our reinvention will be centered on creating mobility of experiences across the entire device family including phones.\\n\\nMapping. Last week, we announced changes to our mapping business and transferred some of our imagery acquisition operations to Uber. We will continue to source base mapping data and imagery from partners. This allows us to focus our efforts on delivering great map products such as Bing Maps, Maps app for Windows and our Bing Maps for Enterprise APIs.\\n\\nAdvertising. We also announced our decision to sharpen our focus in advertising platform technology and concentrate on search, while we partner with AOL and AppNexus for display. Bing will now power search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio of sites, in addition to the partnerships we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon and Apple. Concentrating on search will help us further accelerate the progress we've been making over the past six years. Last year Bing grew to 20 percent query share in the U.S. while growing our search advertising revenue 28 percent over the past 12 months. We view search technology as core to our efforts spanning Bing.com, Cortana, Office 365, Windows 10 and Azure services.\\n\\nI deeply appreciate all of the ideas and hard work of everyone involved in these businesses, and I want to reiterate my commitment to helping each individual impacted.\\n\\nI know many of you have questions about these changes.

It stamped! Repeat as necessary ( I rotated too. )\\n\\nChapter 3 - Image Scaling\\n\\nSo say you scanned something and the image is WAY too big and you want it smaller. How do you go about that?\\n\\nWell, open up paint and paste your image in. I didn't have anything massive to scan so I used this picture of a Dr Pepper.\\n\\nNow, say you want it smaller. You probably try to highlight it and scale it, right? It ends up looking compressed and improportioned.\\n\\nWell, there's an easier way. All it takes is a single keystroke!\\n\\nCtrl+Plus(Numpad) to make it larger or Ctrl+Minus(Numpad) to make it smaller.\\n\\nThis is especially useful for scaling sprites, as it keeps their pixels proportional.\\n\\nChapter 4 - Color Replacement\\n\\nSay you have drawn something with an absolutely crazy pixel border, and all of a sudden you don't like the border color.\\n\\nLike this box I drew.\\n\\nNow, I want to re-color the border yellow but I have absolutely 0 time and 0 energy.

Instead, the larger message that comes through these newly disclosed opinions is the pervasiveness of compliance incidents, and the extent to which careful supervision by the FISA Court, while apparently able to produce some accountability in response to such incidents (as in the opinions released yesterday), simply does not seem to have mooted these concerns. That is to say, with every new FISA Court opinion responding to new compliance incidents, it becomes that much harder to trust that compliance concerns are ancient history.\\n\\nThroughout this process of discussing the NSA\\'s surveillance efforts, thanks to Ed Snowden and his whistleblowing, defenders have continued to insist (1) that the NSA isn\\'t abusing its powers and (2) that there\\'s tremendous oversight of the NSA\\'s activities, mainly by FISC.

After all, these problems appeared to go on for years, and were either unreported or not clearly reported to the FISC, which could do little about it.And that raises a key question, pointed out by Steve Vladeck -- Given these two relatively recent rulings, detailing systematic, widespread and long-term abuses by the NSA in violation of the law, how can any NSA defender claim with a straight face that the NSA is now in compliance Of course, when there\\'s no real \"cost\" for being non-compliant, why would the NSA care that much about being compliant?',\n",

On the face of it, even though American became the first operator of the 777-300 in America, this event would almost seem overkill if for that reason alone. After all, American began 777-200 flights back in 1999 and On January 31, 2013 American Airlines launched their first Boeing 777-300ER into service with attention that rivaled any airline\\'s launch of a new type in recent memory. On the face of it, even though American became the first operator of the 777-300 in America, this event would almost seem overkill if for that reason alone. After all, American began 777-200 flights back in 1999 and the first 777-300 was first delivered to an airline, Cathay Pacific back in May, 1998 . The first 777-300ER entered service nearly 10 years ago with Air France. Boeing\\'s two stretch variants of their venerable cash cow, the 777, easily have become the type\\'s most popular versions with over 680 orders and deliveries between them out of the entire 777 program\\'s 1,380 orders and deliveries. (as of December, 2012). In an era of smaller airliners, American inaugurated the 777-300, the largest new airliner by a U.S. carrier since the last Boeing 747-400s entered service with U.S. airliners in the late 1990s.\\n\\nThis inaugural, flight 963, from Dallas/Ft. Worth to São Paulo, Brazil in the author\\'s view is one of the most significant in the airline industry in years because it is about something much bigger than just the launch of a new airliner, it\\'s about the re-birth of a proud American institution that happens to bear the name of our country – American Airlines.\\n\\nAmerican Airlines problems are well known. After becoming the world\\'s largest airline with its 2000 acquisition of TWA, the 2000s were not kind at all to the Silver Bird. TWA and American merged during an economic downturn and by most accounts, the merger was anything but an unqualified success. American shed most of TWA\\'s assets, routes, staff, and many of its aircraft. On September 11th, 2 of American\\'s airliners, their crew, and passengers were forever lost in the atrocities of this horrible day. As if things couldn\\'t get any worse, the world\\'s airline industry hemorrhaged with the U.S. legacy carriers losing more money during this time then they had profited in their entire history. All of them declared Chapter 11, with the exception of American. Under the category of \"no good deed goes unpunished\", this decision would come back to haunt American for years. The competitors were able to re-organize, upgrade service, rebrand their images, get their costs under control, renew their fleets, expand their route structure, and finally in the case of Continental/United and Delta/Northwest consolidate into mega-carriers that dwarfed American. American was left with a barrage of serious problems: a revolving door in the executive ranks, fractious management and labor relations, dwindling market share, increasingly massive financial losses as their competitors recorded profits, devastating operational problems of which many were self-inflicted, an aging fleet, outdated and stripped down in-flight passenger service, soaring operating expenses, declining bookings, and a very unsympathetic press that at times almost seemed on a witch hunt. Like Pan Am and other failed airlines there were a few bright spots: the extremely profitable Latin American hub, the North Atlantic / London Heathrow joint-venture with British Airways, the strong and dominant hubs particularly at DFW and Miami, strength on the highly profitable trans-continental services particular JFK-LAX, and many proud employees across all positions who still believed their company could once again live up to American\\'s 1980s advertising claim that they were \"Something Special in the Air\".\\n\\nBut the headwinds seemed to far outweigh the tailwinds and finally on November 29, 2011 American filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy becoming the last U.S. legacy carrier to do so. On top of that, US Airways began aggressively pursuing a merger, securing an agreement with the pilots unions. Then came the 2012 \"Summer of Discontent\" with flight cancellations and operations disruptions that sent customers into the arms of their competitors and who can forget the seats onboard a few 757s becoming unbolted during flights. It would have been understandable for the once proud Eagle to fold its wings. If the one unthinkable collapses of majors like Pan Am and Eastern occurred, could American meet the same fate?\\n\\nIt may be hard to remember, but since the beginning of commercial aviation: American was an innovating pace setter in the industry, and generally a profitable one at that. In many ways, American virtually wrote the history of the airline industry: American introduced the airliner that changed aviation, the Douglas DC-3. The first',\n",

       " 'The Role of Belgian Colonization\\nAfter WWI, the Treaty of Versailles was signed and it affected Germany in many ways. One way was the colony of Rwanda-Urundi was taken away from Germany and made a League of Nations protectorate that was put under Belgian rule. The Belgians reinforced the class system that the Germans had imposed, further separating the Tutsies and the Hutus. The Belgians favored the Tutsies (even though they only made up 14% of Rwanda, whereas the Hutus made up 85% of the country. The Tutsies were given many privileges that the Hutu were not fortunate enough to receive, including western-style education and political power. The Belgians used the Tutsi to rule the country, having these people enforce what the Belgians believed and what the Belgians wanted done. Therefore the Tutsies were essentially puppets and the Belgians were the puppet masters. The Belgians insisted that Rwanda start to grow coffee, the corvee was introduced (this is form of labor in which each worker is whipped eight times before work each morning). The onerous corvee was not popular and many people fled to Uganda. I would have left Rwanda if I was a slave because being beaten before I started my day would make me not want to work and it would enrage me everyday. The Belgians began to focus more and more on race and they did studies that proved, in there eyes, that the Tutsies were superior. Scientists were brought into the country to measure skulls sizes (to see which group of people had a bigger skull and therefore a bigger brain-now we know that brain size is irrelevant to intelligence). Tutsies were also taller and lighter skinned so the Belgians believed they were of Caucasian decent, therefore making them \"better\" than the Hutus. Racial identification cards were also distributed which identified if the citizens of Rwanda were Hutu or Tutsi. As time went on, the idea that the Tutsies were superior to the Hutu became so ingrained in the minds of the Tutsies that they started to believe this idea and exploited their power over the Hutu. Resentment, anger, and confusion flooded the hearts and minds of the Hutu. These emotions started to build up over time and as the people entered the 1990\\'s, these emotions were about to explode.

       " 'KITIGAN ZIBI ANISHINABEG FIRST NATION, Quebec — Jay Odjick\\'s affinity for comics started early. He bought his first Spider-Man comic book for 20 cents at the age of four. And it wasn\\'t long before he felt the pull to write stories of his own. \"My mother says I started writing my own comic stories when I was around five,\" Odjick said. \"But the caveat I always add is that my mother doesn\\'t say I started writing good stories.\" Odjick has steadily improved his skills over the years. Now 39, he\\'s the creator of \"Kagagi,\" a graphic novel that\\'s professionally published and distributed across North America. Like many graphic novels, \"Kagagi\" includes evil villains and superhuman powers. But what makes this comic book unique is that the characters and the storyline are deeply rooted in Algonquin culture. Odjick, who is from the Kitigan Zibi Anishnabeg Algonquin First Nation in Quebec, is one of a growing number of indigenous writers and artists who are jumping into the billion-dollar comics industry. Many bring their own life experiences and cultural traditions to their stories. And critics say their work is starting to reshape the way indigenous people are portrayed in this popular medium.\\n\\nI thought it was really important that I create heroes that young Natives could relate to. Jon Proudstar, comic book artist\\n\\nIn \"Kagagi,\" Odjick\\'s culture plays a central role from the very beginning, as the storyline springboards off of the Algonquin legend of Windigo, the story of an evil creature with the power to possess humans and turn them into cannibals. The victims become \"kind of like zombies,\" Odjick said. And the only person who can stop the Windigo? A 16-year old Anishnabe boy with superhuman strength and the ability to fly. An animated version of \"Kagagi\" currently airs on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, a cable channel whose programming reaches about 10 million households throughout Canada. Each episode is broadcast in both English and Algonquin. In a world where many indigenous tribes struggle to maintain their language, Odjick says he is excited about the opportunity to help preserve part of his culture \"I\\'m not an educator,\" he says, \"but we can present language in a way that\\'s entertaining to [kids].\"\\n\\nFinding new heroes\\n\\nAccording to Michael Sheyahshe, author of \"Native Americans In Comic Books,\" Odjick\\'s celebration of Native culture is a long way from how Native Americans were portrayed in comics when the medium first rose to popularity. Sheyahshe, who is a member of the Caddo Nation in Oklahoma, says when comic books first began seeing major commercial success in the 1940s, Native Americans were only written as diminutive one-dimensional characters and often portrayed as a threat to white protagonists. By the 1960s and 1970s, though, Native characters began to play a more centralized role in storylines as various civil rights movements took hold throughout the United States. Sheyahshe cites Marvel\\'s Red Wolf, a nine-issue series that featured the publishing house\\'s first Native American superhero, as an example.\\n\\nCover of Jon Proudstar\\'s \"Tribal Force\" Jon Proudstar Still, Sheyahshe says that in that time period, almost none of the Native characters were the main heroes. \"They\\'re the helpers. They did what they were supposed to,\" he said. \"[The heroes] couldn\\'t have gotten the job done without them, but [Native characters] didn\\'t have series of their own.\" Sheyahshe says it has only been in recent years that he\\'s begun to notice Native artists producing comic books starring Native characters. One of the first on the scene was Jon Proudstar\\'s 1996 series \"Tribal Force,\" a story about five young people granted supernatural powers in order to protect their land from being destroyed by the government. Proudstar said he also takes great pride in his attention to detail. He didn\\'t just stick with characters from his own community near Tucson, Arizona. Each of his characters comes from a different tribe, and he spent a lot of time making sure their cultures were accurately and respectfully depicted. \"I knew very little about the Hunkpapa Sioux,\" he says, \"So I went to a couple of people who are Hunkpapa and asked them about their communities, what\\'s important to them.\" His White Calf Buffalo Woman is one result of this research. After Proudstar learned that depictions of the White Calf Buffalo Woman are among the culture\\'s most sacred images, he adapted her character to appear in the book as only a silhouette. Proudstar said seeing Native American stereotypes and inaccuracies continue to show up in comic books was a big motivation for his work. But Proudstar also wanted to create a universe in which heroes face the same challenges that many Native kids face today, like living with the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome and child molestation,',\n",

She suggests that \"even someone who is mentally ill and has been convicted of domestic violence can still obtain a firearm due to various background-check loopholes.\" To be fair, this is not true. Individuals who are involuntarily committed for mental illness treatment are barred from buying guns–involuntarily commitment is a threshold that must be crossed. But the judge who handled John Russell Houser\\'s mental oversight– Carroll County Probate Judge Betty Cason–said she never ordered him involuntarily committed.\\n\\nSo, there already is a mechanism for keeping the mentally ill from obtaining guns, but they have to meet a certain threshold before being barred from gun purchases.\\n\\nInstead of admitting this, Schumer just mocks the system. She points to blind people and people on the terror watch list buying guns, then says, \"\"I\\'m all about equal rights for the disabled, but if Stevie Wonder calls me and he\\'s like, \\'Do you want to go shooting today?\\' I\\'m going to be like, \\'Hard pass!\\'\" Schumer does not mention the fact that neither the terror attack in San Bernadino (December 2, 2015) nor Orlando (June 12, 2o16) would have been stopped by adding the terror watch list to background checks because none of the attackers in either case were on the list.\\n\\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

       " 'You may have heard that Ubisoft have a new Tom Clancy game coming out this year called The Division. If you\\'ve played literally any other Tom Clancy game before, you probably have a pretty good idea on what The Division is like.\\n\\nWait, no. That\\'s not right at all. The Division is unlike any Tom Clancy game you\\'ve played before. That\\'s because it\\'s a big open-world RPG. Yeah, like those games with dragons, but this time it\\'s bio-terrorism instead. That may sound strange, but The Division is actually really good at being a role-playing game.\\n\\nHere\\'s ten reasons why The Division is the next big thing in PC RPGs.\\n\\n1 – It\\'s genuinely an RPG\\n\\nLet\\'s get one thing straight: The Division is an RPG. And I don\\'t mean it\\'s a third-person shooter with some upgrade stats: this is a full-out, numbers-led RPG to stand in the stables next to Diablo III and Borderlands. Both you and enemies have hit points, you can increase your weapon DPS by bolting on mods, and you level up by gaining XP for kills and quest completion. It\\'s even got a character creator. The only way it could be any more RPG is if Chris Avellone was writing it.\\n\\n\"From the beginning when we set out to do an RPG,\" explains creative director Magnus Jansén. \"We wanted to do something where your investment and your tactics matter.\"\\n\\nBecause it\\'s an RPG, The Division\\'s combat is nothing like the one-hit-kill firefights of other Tom Clancy games. \"To honour your [weapon and skill] choices, and doing tactical combat in the RPG setting, we\\'ve made some concessions to the absolute reality,\" says Jansén. As such, enemies must be fired upon until their HP depletes, rather than simply double-tapped in the head.\\n\\n\"We keep you immersed with the fact that enemies have body armour and various things to explain why some people take a lot more damage than others,\" explains Jansén in regards to the more bullet sponge-y enemies.\\n\\n2 – It\\'s not competing with the MMO crowd\\n\\nMMO\\'s have their definition in the title: massive, multiplayer, and online. While The Division is online and multiplayer, it\\'s certainly not massive in terms of players. In the questing zones of its Midtown Manhattan, you\\'ll be with just three other co-op players at most. Head into the Dark Zone – the highly contaminated PvP area at the centre of the map – and things get busier, but not by much.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not a crowded place,\" reveals Jansén. \"We want to keep encounters something interesting, so the Dark Zone is not crowded.\"\\n\\nThe technical numbers behind the Dark Zone is support for about 20 – 24 players, but you\\'ll likely never see that many all in one area. \"There are lots and lots of square miles, so we tried to fill that up with people to reach a certain density,\" says Jansén. \"You\\'ll walk a couple of blocks and you\\'re likely to maybe see one person. If you make a lot of noise, like during an extraction, then you\\'re likely to attract a handful of people, maybe one or two groups.\"\\n\\nBasically, your immersion in the world won\\'t be ruined by a server of 200 people teabagging corpses.\\n\\n3 – It\\'s proper Tom Clancy\\n\\nDid you know that The Division is real? Well, sort of. It\\'s based on Operation Dark Winter, a simulation carried out in 2001 by the American government to see how well the country would cope with a smallpox epidemic. The answer was pretty simple: we\\'re doomed. Society and infrastructure would collapse, leading to disaster in the streets.\\n\\nThat\\'s scary for us in real life, but it\\'s the perfect start to a Tom Clancy novel. Since Tom himself is no longer with us, it\\'s left to Ubisoft to tell the tale. For The Division, the epidemic all starts on Black Friday, with the virus being passed around on banknotes. Get it? It\\'s the downfall of capitalism thanks to rampant consumerism. Clever, eh?\\n\\nSaving us all from anarchy are the agents of The Division themselves: men and women with access to tons and tons of military hardware, ready to shoot the heck out of those who would try and destroy America by looting the abandoned buildings of New York. Yup, this is a Clancy story alright.\\n\\n4 – It\\'s an open world that feels real\\n\\nIt\\'s mandatory to have an open world in RPGs these days, and The Division certainly has one. It\\'s a close-enough 1:1 recreation of Midtown Manhattan, complete with major spots like Madison Square Garden, Times Square, and the Lincoln Tunnel. Because of the strive for accuracy, you won\\'t find a single copy-paste street corner in The Division. And thanks to being a',\n",

       " \"The world's largest asset managers have held secret summit meetings to hammer out proposals for improving public company governance to encourage longer-term investment and reduce friction with shareholders.\\n\\nJamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and Warren Buffett convened the sessions with the heads of BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard and Capital Group to work on a new statement of best practice that would cover the relationship between US companies and their investors.\\n\\nThe unusual collaboration comes at a time of rising shareholder activism and a raging debate about whether public markets demand short-term profits at the expense of long-term investment.\\n\\nAndrew Hill Lasting lessons for smug CEOs and somnolent shareholders Directors must call out poor managers before they destroy the companies they run\\n\\nIn recent years, some private companies have shunned early public listings, and technology bosses such as Michael Dell have argued that equity markets are too focused on short-term gains. Some large technology groups have also gone public with dual-class share structures that limit shareholder rights in an effort to minimise the influence of activist hedge funds.\\n\\nThe asset management bosses, including Abby Johnson of Fidelity, Larry Fink of BlackRock and Tim Armour of Capital Group, met most recently at JPMorgan's New York headquarters in December, the Financial Times has learnt, following a first meeting in August.\\n\\nThe group is discussing a statement of best practice on corporate governance. Discussions have focused on issues such as the role of board directors, executive compensation, board tenure and shareholder rights, all of which have been flashpoints at US annual meetings.\\n\\nMr Dimon, in particular, has reason to hope for a rapprochement between boards and long-term shareholders. He has faced personal criticism for combining the role of chairman and chief executive at JPMorgan, and at the company's last two annual meetings, more than a third of its shareholders voted that he should split the roles.\\n\\nAs well as being a major player in capital markets, JPMorgan also has an asset management arm that is one of the US equity market's largest investors, with $1.7tn in assets. Mr Buffett, a long-time friend of Mr Dimon, has eschewed many corporate governance norms at his company, Berkshire Hathaway.\\n\\nOther contributors to the initiative are understood to include Mark Wiseman of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Jeff Ubben of ValueAct, an activist hedge fund manager.\\n\\nPodcast Alphachat: How short-termism is misunderstood Credit Suisse's Michael Mauboussin discusses corporate short-termism with host Cardiff Garcia\\n\\nNo participants agreed to be quoted on the initiative, which is not expected to come to fruition for several months. The asset managers hope to come up with a list of best practices that they will support at the companies they invest in.\\n\\nThe move comes amid a debate on shareholder rights and responsibilities and on the balance of power between investors, boards and management. Activist hedge funds with more than $100bn in assets have used their muscle to demand board changes and push companies to increase returns to shareholders, often through share buybacks.\\n\\nThe largest companies typically face a half-dozen or more votes from dissident shareholders at each annual meeting, on topics ranging from executive compensation to environmental policies and political lobbying.\\n\\nAn increasing number of US companies have also agreed this year to offer long-term shareholders the right to nominate their own candidates for board directors.\\n\\nThe volume of initial public offerings tumbled 42 per cent in the US last year despite the growing economy, as companies sought investors — including some traditional public markets investors — who were willing to buy shares even while they remained private.\\n\\nLetter in response to this report:\\n\\nBoards fail when executives are captured / From Bevis Longstreth\",\n",
       " 'How to Preload Images\\n\\n\"Preloading\" loads an image file into the users\\' computer memory so that it can be instantly accessed when needed. This is useful, for example, if you have a mouseover event and an image needs to change without any delay.\\n\\nOption 1: Nice and Simple\\n\\nTo preload an image into your web page, paste the code below into the document head (replace the red image file name with your own):\\n\\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> if (document.images) { img1 = new Image(); img1.src = \" image.jpg \"; } </script>\\n\\nYou can add more images by duplicating the image lines, e.g.:\\n\\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> if (document.images) { img1 = new Image(); img1.src = \" image.jpg \"; img2 = new Image(); img2.src = \" image2.jpg \"; } </script>\\n\\nOption 2: A Flexible Array\\n\\nThis method can be used if you have an external JavaScript file that is used by multiple pages. Use the same function to easily preload any number of images on different pages. Firstly, add the following function to your main JavaScript file:\\n\\nfunction preload(images) { if (document.images) { var i = 0; var imageArray = new Array(); imageArray = images.split(\\',\\'); var imageObj = new Image(); for(i=0; i<=imageArray.length-1; i++) { //document.write(\\'<img src=\"\\' + imageArray[i] + \\'\" />\\');// Write to page (uncomment to check images) imageObj.src=imageArray[i]; } } }\\n\\nThen in the <head> of each web page, add the following code after you\\'ve called the main JavaScript file:\\n\\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> preload(\\' image1.jpg , image2.jpg , image3.jpg \\'); </script>\\n\\nReplace the file names in red with your own files. You can have as many as you like, just make sure that they are separated by a comma.\\n\\nOption 3: No JavaScript\\n\\nYou can also preload an image without JavaScript by creating a 1 pixel square version of the file and hiding it somewhere on the page, like so:\\n\\n<image src=\"picture.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\">',\n",
       " \"Taking Stock\\n\\nNext session, I shared the list of problems I was able to compile.\\n\\nProblem #1: Logistics. I have the asset sheet, but don't know how to quit my job and convert my net worth into income I can live on.\\n\\nProblem #2: What comes next? I have absolutely no idea what to do with the next phase of my life. I just know I don't want to be in my industry anymore. It isn't that I hate it. I don't. It's just that it no longer provides significant challenges or pleasure. I'm suddenly unsure if it ever did. My role is mostly mechanical: I go through the motions. I'm an expert. I receive work and I do it and I don't think twice about whether or not I'm enjoying it. It just happens – it's part of me. How do I get rid of this?\\n\\nProblem #3: What happens to my previous life? What will I tell people? Will I lose friends? What will I do with the loss of structure?\\n\\nProblem #4: What will I do to make me feel like I'm giving back? I don't think that what I currently do is all that important, but at the very least, I perform my function well and folks are happy with my contributions. This gives me some small sense of value and esteem. What will replace this?\\n\\nProblem #5: Purposelessness at work. Although I produce some amount of valuable work for my employer every week, most of the hours are spent idling. I'm stuck there, cannot leave, cannot work-from-home, and cannot stand this aspect of the job now that I'm FI. It was tolerable in the past, when I had a slow stint at a previous employer, but that's because I still really needed the salary, which filled me with a sense of purpose and made the idleness seem like a useful activity by the fact that it was driving me toward completion of a long-standing goal.\\n\\nProblem #6: The Bucket of Fear. I have all sorts of concerns about moving from FI to RE status, most of which I articulated in this post. At the time of these issues, back in 2013, the biggest one was the idea that I'd do nothing — absolutely nothing — after retiring. Maybe I'd become like Peggy Bundy on Married… With Children, watching soap operas during the day and eating bon-bons. Or, worse, I'd return to my old drinking problem.\\n\\nProblem #7: I Feel Older. With age, most people feel a decreased sense of possibility in life. Fewer paths are available to follow. Many of your choices have already been made. You have launched. There is no returning to Earth for another unique blastoff in a totally different direction; your primary trajectory has been defined, for better or worse. This isn't to say that there aren't plenty of paths still open to you, but the fact remains that some are closed. For example, you will not, at age 35, become an Olympic-calibre swimmer. (You could, however, still become a good one.)\\n\\nProblem #8: My Significant Other is Not Totally Cool With All Of This. Enough said.\\n\\nI added that some of these problems I think about frequently — like the finances, and feeling purposeless — while others I do my best to ignore. After I dumped all of this stuff on him, Dr. Katz told me to start working on logistics first.\\n\\nMy suggestion? Tackle the finances immediately. It'll be the easiest to resolve because it's strictly a numbers game and it'll be good to cross something quickly off your list. You think you have enough to retire? Well, you don't have to prove it to me. You have to prove it to yourself. Break things down and get comfortable with your own plans. Only you can assert that you're fully covered on this.\\n\\nDo the research that needs to be done. Crunch numbers. Create spreadsheets. Find Jesus. Whatever it takes.\\n\\nHe also immediately commented on #4, Giving back, telling me that this is all in my head. I don't have to give back to anyone, ever. I know, it's just one man's opinion, but he was very clear and passionate on this point. I wondered briefly if he was a Libertarian.\\n\\nAnd to be honest, this completely shocked me. The last thing I expected was for a goddamned therapist to tell me something is quote all in my head. I thought these people (read: analysts) were, as a rule, paid to indulge their clients — to say precisely the opposite. Something along the lines of: Oh, well you think that way because of your upbringing. But let's examine the substrate of these mental patterns: Tell me about your mother.\\n\\nStill, his point was clear: I needed to stop worrying about the expectations of others, the\",\n",

That\\'s right, the bouncing, rubbery, ice skate with wheels is back. But don\\'t groan just yet. BioWare has been doing some interesting work to make sure that the Mako is more universally liked this time around - and that involves getting a little help from a team that knows its stuff about racers.\\n\\n\\nBoth Mac Walters (Creative Director on Mass Effect: Andromeda) and Aaron Flynn (general manager at BioWare) were very forthcoming that the Mako wasn\\'t just awkward to drive, but that you couldn\\'t do a lot of interesting stuff with it. \"So that\\'s all going to get fixed,\" Flynn tells me. \"When we thought about bringing the Mako back, we said: \\'We can\\'t bring the Mako back as an iteration of the Mako. It has to be a high quality experience that compares well to any driving simulation by doing that.\\'\"\\n\\nSo what do you do when you need to overhaul your vehicles, and you\\'re part of a huge corporation with teams working on multiple different kinds of projects? You bring on the Need for Speed team to help out. \"One really fortuitous thing is that, because so many other teams are on Frostbite now, the Need for Speed folks had done a couple of games on Frostbite at that point,\" Flynn explains. \"They were more than happy to lend a hand and offer advice and guidance to our developers to make sure that the Mako, when we actually get it all done, drives and plays great. It doesn\\'t feel like you have those many, many edge cases the Mako in [the first Mass Effect] had where you could do crazy stuff with it. So that won\\'t be there, knock on wood.\"\\n\\n\\nMaking the Mako control well, and making it take advantage of the newer open spaces all goes back to a single point: that the team wants to make the Mako actually fun to play. \"I think we\\'ve approached pretty much everything with Mass Effect: Andromeda that we shouldn\\'t have assumptions about the way we\\'ve done things in the past,\" Walters tells me. \"Some things have worked very well, other things haven\\'t, so we looked at the Mako, we said \\'Is it fun?\\' That had to be the question we wanted to answer first.

       " 'Is climbing ruining your posture?\\n\\nClimbing is great exercise for your arms and back, but is it also affecting your spine in a negative way?\\n\\nClimbing uses a constant rowing motion, or a downward pulling motion. These types of motions utilize muscles in your back like: the latissimus, rhomboids, middle and lower trapezius. These muscles often play a role in good posture, they keep your shoulders back and your spine upright. So, how might climbing be making your posture worse?\\n\\nIt is the simple resting posture on the wall. Climbers do this naturally to be more efficient in their muscle use. Do you tend to rest; how often and for how long on each climb? Most climbers will tell you to take rest brakes on the wall and let everything \"hang loose\" and relax the muscles in your back and even in your arms. This is done to use your body in the most efficient way and expend the least amount of energy. This is where the problem lies because normal resting posture puts your spine in a position called kyphosis.There is a natural kyphosis in your mid back but we are putting that to the extreme when we climb. Our normal population and especially the younger generations are already increasing this kyphosis with electronics use and regular sitting/standing posture. So, for us climbers, we need to prevent our physical activities from increase this kyphosis even further!\\n\\nWhy is this bad? A limitation in the thoracic spine, or mid back, can often lead to back pain, shoulder pain, and neck pain. When one segment in the body is limited it affects everything else above and below that segment.\\n\\nWhat can you do to change this?\\n\\nThe answer is simple! You need to work on extension in the mid back as well as opening the front of your body. Then train the muscles in your chest to equalize your strength ratio from front to back. Below are some examples of exercises and soft tissue releases that can help protect your back, neck, and shoulders to keep you reaching new heights!\\n\\nScorpion\\n\\nFoam Roller in extension\\n\\nLacrosse ball pec release\\n\\nPush-up / bench press\\n\\nFront plank / side plank\\n\\nIf you have any questions about strength training and form when it comes to rock climbing please feel free to contact me at bwally@mainephysicaltherapy.com.

The smuggling network was not identified.\\n\\nArmy Col. Lisa A. Garcia, a Southcom spokeswoman, did not address the intelligence report directly but said Sunni terrorist infiltration is a security concern.\\n\\n\"Networks that specialize in smuggling individuals from regions of terrorist concern, mainly from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, the Middle East, and East Africa, are indeed a concern for Southcom and other interagency security partners who support our country\\'s national security,\" Garcia told the Washington Free Beacon.\\n\\n\"There are major hubs that serve as entry points into the region for migrants from those areas of concern attempting to enter the U.S. along our border with Mexico,\" she said.\\n\\nThe infiltrators from terrorist states and unstable regions exploit vulnerabilities in commercial transportation systems and immigration enforcement agencies in some of the countries used for transit, Garcia said.\\n\\n\"In 2015, we saw a total of 331,000 migrants enter the southwestern border between the U.S. and Mexico, of that we estimate more than 30,000 of those were from countries of terrorist concern,\" she said.\\n\\nAnother problem in dealing with migrants from the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia is a lack of information among the governments of the countries used by potential terrorists for transit.\\n\\nThe exploitation of alien smuggling networks by terrorists until recently had been dismissed by both American security officials and private security experts as largely an urban myth.\\n\\nHowever, the Southcom intelligence report revealed that the threat of Islamist terror infiltration is no longer theoretical. \"This makes the case for Trump\\'s wall,\" said one American security official of the Southcom report. \"These guys are doing whatever they want to get in the country.\"\\n\\nAdm. Kurt Tidd, Southcom\\'s commander, said last week that the lack of information is hampering security efforts against alien smuggling.\\n\\n\"An element that has been long recognized is that our ability to track people moving through transportation systems is an area that we must continue to devote efforts on, and the ease with which human traffickers are able to use our transportation systems to move people through the networks relatively undetected should give us all concern,\" Tidd said.\\n\\nSpecial interest aliens are described by the U.S. government as aliens who pose a potential terrorism threat coming from 34 nations in the Middle East, Africa, Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and East Asia. The list of states of concern includes Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Eritrea, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\\n\\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump last week called for stepped up counterterrorism measures that he said would involve \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants in a bid to better screen out potential terrorists.\\n\\nTrump also has made a campaign theme the construction of a wall across the United States\\' southern border as part of efforts to better control the flood of illegal immigrants.\\n\\nJoel Vargas, head of Contingent Security Services and a consultant to law enforcement agencies, said there is no evidence Sunni extremists are creating new relationships with alien smugglers. However, he said in an email that \"existing smuggling networks from Central America are increasing their access.\"\\n\\n\"We have intercepted immigrants coming from Asia but we have been unable to determine if they are extremists,\" Vargas said. \"Our Sunni illegal migration coming from [Latin America] is very small.

       " 'Ugh. I seriously hate my life. Everything\\'s just so messed up right now. I just need a minute to vent about it or something. Maybe that\\'ll help me feel better.\\n\\nSo, I tried talking to Tante Joce the other day about moving out… And she just shut me down! She wouldn\\'t even listen to what I had to say!\\n\\nShe just kept saying all this shit about how I can\\'t afford it – even though I have tens of thousands of euros sitting in a bank account waiting for me! Actually more like hundreds of thousands, I bet. Papa and Onkel Florian\\'s band never really hit it as big as other bands out there, but I\\'m not an idiot. I know they did pretty damn well for themselves. And I know Papa left me more than enough to be able to live on my own!\\n\\nBut of course Tante Joce said no.\\n\\nAnd when I even said I\\'d get a job to pay for rent instead (which I\\'d totally be willing to do!) she still shot me down!\\n\\nThis is exactly what I\\'m talking about when I say she babies me – she won\\'t listen. She won\\'t give me a chance!\\n\\nIt made me so mad… And then I kinda made things worse, I guess.\\n\\nI ended up calling her a bitch. And I\\'ve never called her that before. Ever. I still feel like shit for saying it. I mean, no matter how ridiculous or unfair she was being, Tante Joce didn\\'t deserve that. I know she didn\\'t. Me and my big mouth.\\n\\nDom says I totally blew it. He thinks she\\'ll probably never understand what I was trying to say, because she\\'ll be too caught up being mad that I called her a bitch. And I kinda can\\'t help worrying that he might be right.\\n\\nBut Remi made me feel a little better, at least. He says River\\'s called Tante Clara a bitch a bunch of times, but it always blows over. \"Mama knows she doesn\\'t mean it,\" he told me. \"I\\'m sure this\\'ll be the same.\"\\n\\nAnd I really, really hope he\\'s right. Because I know I can\\'t apologize now, no matter how bad I feel. It\\'s too late. It\\'s been too long. And it\\'ll make it look like I\\'m saying she was right or something. And she wasn\\'t. She was being ridiculous and overprotective, just like she always is.\\n\\nAnyway, I think Remi maybe had a point. I mean, it\\'s been like three days, and Tante Joce still hasn\\'t mentioned it. So maybe she\\'s over it? Of course, she hasn\\'t really said much to me at all, to be honest. Neither has grandpa. Or Oma and Opa. It almost feels like Tante Joce asked them not to. I mean, grandpa\\'s been giving me these… \\'looks\\', y\\'know? Like he really wants to say something. But he never does.\\n\\nI guess they\\'ve all kinda been looking at me a little weird though. Sometimes it\\'s like they\\'re mad. But other times it\\'s like they\\'re… nervous? Waiting for something to happen, I guess? It\\'s kinda hard to explain.\\n\\nEven the girls noticed something was up. The three of them cornered me after dinner last night and asked me what happened… They could tell there was something weird going on. So I told them about it (minus the part where I called their mom a bitch… Something told me that wouldn\\'t be the best idea).\\n\\nTony got all nervous and started spewing all the same garbage Tante Joce was saying about why moving out\\'s a bad idea and how Tante Joce is just worried about me and blah blah blah. Typical Tony. I get that she\\'s trying to help, but… Ugh.\\n\\nAnd I couldn\\'t believe it, but Alex actually laughed at me. She told me I\\'m being an idiot, and says everyone\\'s probably acting funny because they\\'re waiting for me to blow up and start \"throwing a temper tantrum\" again. Yeah, whatever. I\\'m starting to think I should have reserved the \"bitch\" title for her instead of Tante Joce…\\n\\nCharlie was the only one who was at least a little helpful. Or at least not mean. Or annoying. She did roll her eyes at me though…\\n\\nBut anyway, she thinks they\\'re afraid I\\'m gonna try to run away or do something stupid like that. \"If you do, it\\'s over.\" That\\'s what she told me. She says if I\\'m serious about this thing, I need to give it some time, then try asking again another way. And in the meantime I should try to \"earn some brownie points\".\\n\\nSounds like the best option, I guess — Play nice',\n",

       " '[soliloquy id=\"18443″]\\n\\nWyrmwood is a movie about the zombie apocalypse (as many movies are these days). It follows two main plot threads. First off, we have Barry (Jay Gallagher) who teams up with various travelers trying to survive in this new world. All the while Barry feels profound remorse and guilt over having had to put a few nails in the heads of his newly-undead wife and child. The story goes in a very Mad Max–esque direction and that os what immediately drew me into this picture. The cast gears up in sporting equipment and makeshift armor and piles into a modded out truck that uses zombies as its\\' fuel source (just go with it).\\n\\nWhile this is all going on, Barry\\'s sister Brooke (Bianca Bradey) has been captured by some kind of military experiment involving zombies and a crazy scientist in a hazmat suit. As she is chained to a wall she slowly begins to develop the ability to control zombies through some sort of telepathy or telekinesis or something (again, just go with it).\\n\\nHere is where I take a bit of an issue. This movie seems like it\\'s at odds with itself and confused as to what it wants to be. It feels like screenwriters Kiah Roache-Turner and Tristan Roache-Turner had two ideas for a zombie movie and instead of choosing one and running with it they tried to do both at the same time. Either story is interesting enough to carry the film, but I wish they had picked one or the other, because both of them are underdeveloped. Characters in Barry\\'s story often get killed off before we learn anything about them and a lot of the details of the zombie fuel thing are left unexplained. Why did all of the regular gas stop working? Why are the zombies suddenly breathing and bleeding fuel? It\\'s the same way with Brooke\\'s story. There are vague allusions to a higher purpose, but we never really know what the military experiment was meant to accomplish. The plot raises too many questions to which we never get answers.\\n\\nScript issues aside, the core cast of Wyrmwood is great. Jay Gallagher steals the show as Barry, going to some real extremes over the course of the movie. He\\'s a blast to watch as guilt turns to anger and he starts to take out his frustrations on the unsuspecting zombie population. Seriously, there are moments where he just runs right up to them and punches them in the face. Having started the movie off in a very dark place it\\'s great to see him just let loose. Leon Bruchill\\'s Benny plays off of Barry really well and they have some nice banter at times. Bianca Bradley as Brooke is tough as nails even before the zombie superpowers kick in. She\\'s badass and always engaging to watch, which is impressive considering how much of the movie she spends with a muzzle on her face while she\\'s tied to a wall.\\n\\nI would be remiss if I didn\\'t mention Berryn Schwerdt as the doctor. I have no idea what his character was doing but oh man is he entertaining. This doctor is dancing to music while sticking syringes in zombies and chewing up the scenery all over his laboratory. He\\'s an over-the-top caricature, but it really works.\\n\\nKiah Roache-Turner shows some real promise in the director\\'s chair as well. Wyrmwood can be a little rough around the edges at times, but for the most part it\\'s a really good looking movie. There\\'s some of the dreaded \"shaky cam,\" but it\\'s never done to an obnoxious degree and always serves to accent the chaos of the situation. There\\'s definitely an eye for color here, too. Some scenes are lit in a saturated and exaggerated way while others are void of color entirely. All of this sets an interesting mood throughout the picture.\\n\\nUltimately, I liked this movie. It\\'s definitely in that \"style over substance\" camp, but sometimes that\\'s enough. The script is all over the place throwing everything but the kitchen sink at you, and while that can be a little off-putting in certain regards it also makes for a hell of an experience. If they had ironed out some of the plot issues this could have been a great movie, but as it stands it\\'s a good one. Wyrmwood is a fun and humorous adventure that doesn\\'t take itself incredibly seriously but still manages to squeeze in some really dark and emotional moments. It\\'s left open for a sequel so who knows… maybe we\\'ll get the answers to those questions some day. You can check it out for yourself in select theaters and VOD February 13, 2015!\\n\\nWICKED RATING: [usr 6]\\n\\nDirector(s): Kiah Roache-Turner\\n\\nWriter(s): Kiah Roache-Turner, Tristan Roache-Turner\\n\\nStars: Jay Gallagher, Bianca Bradey',\n",

       " 'The burned Doctors Without Borders hospital is seen after explosions in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz, on Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015. (Médecins Sans Frontières via AP)\\n\\nAfter nearly an hour of bombing on its hospital in the Afghan city of Kunduz, a Doctors Without Borders representative in Kabul received a text message from a U.S. military official in response to the group\\'s pleas to stop the attack: \"I\\'ll do my best,\" said the text message from the American, who was also in Kabul. \"Praying for you all.\"\\n\\nThe 2:59 a.m. message is included in a log released by Doctors Without Borders on Thursday in a report on the Oct. 3 bombing of its Kunduz medical facility by the U.S. military. The first bombs from a U.S. AC-130 gunship fell between 2 a.m. and 2:08 a.m., prompting a flurry of calls from the medical organization, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières Global (MSF), for the airstrikes to stop.\\n\\n[Pentagon faces question: Should it make condolence payments for Taliban killed in hospital bombing?]\\n\\nThe report was released by MSF to be transparent and counter speculation that the hospital was being used as a Taliban military base, the medical organization said. The hospital was treating Afghan civilians, Taliban fighters and civilians the night of the airstrikes, it said.\\n\\nThe bombing came as the U.S. and Afghan militaries fought to take back the city of Kunduz, which had fallen to the Taliban a few days before. Some 30 medical staff members and patients were killed, with some burned beyond recognition.\\n\\n\"The question remains as to whether our hospital lost protected status in the eyes of the military forces engaged in this attack — and if so, why,\" said Joanne Liu, MSF\\'s international president, in a letter included with the report. \"This answer does not lie within the MSF hospital. Those responsible for requesting, ordering and approving the airstrikes hold these answers.\"\\n\\nA Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said Thursday that MSF shared its report with the military ahead of releasing it. Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, also met with MSF leaders in Afghanistan on Wednesday, Davis added.\\n\\n\"We continue to work closely with MSF in identifying the victims killed and wounded so we can conclude our investigations and proceed with follow-on actions, to include condolence payments. We\\'re also committed to working with MSF to determine the full extent of the damage on the hospital so that it can be repaired in full.\"\\n\\nMSF began making calls about the airstrikes, which remain under investigation by the U.S. military, no more than 11 minutes after the first airstrikes hit the hospital, the report said. At 2:19 a.m., an MSF official called the top U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan to say that the hospital had been hit with an airstrike, but the bombs continued to fall.\\n\\n[In northern Afghanistan, a mix of Taliban, foreign fighters and soldiers spread thin]\\n\\nMSF followed up with a 2:20 a.m. phone call to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and calls at 2:32 a.m. to a Defense Department official in Washington and a United Nations liaison in Afghanistan, the report said. As the airstrikes continued, a military official at the U.S. military headquarters in Kabul apologized in a text message at 2:52 a.m.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry to hear that, I still do not know what happened,\" the text message said, according to the MSF report.\\n\\nThe message exchange as it appears in the report follows. Resolute Support is shorthand for the headquarters by the same name, which leads U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and is near the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. OCHA CivMil is short for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\\' civil-military liaison in Afghanistan.\\n\\n\\nThe humanitarian group assured the U.S. military its hospital in northern Afghanistan was not under Taliban threat just days before a deadly airstrike on the compound last month, the organization said Thursday.\\n\\nThe group continued to push for an independent investigation into one of the deadliest civilian casualty incidents stemming from a coalition action in the Afghan conflict. The U.S. military and others are currently conducting parallel reviews into the chain of events leading to the more than hour-long attack.\\n\\nCampbell told The Washington Post in an interview in Kabul on Friday that the military is obligated by law to do what is known in military parlance as a 15-6 investigation, after the Army regulation that lays out the rules for investigating officers. He expects to have the initial results of that soon, but declined to be more specific with a time table.\\n\\nCampbell added that he does not',\n",
       " 'I noted earlier that Sen. John McCain has taken a strange position on the Libyan conflict: He\\'s been calling for the ouster of Moammar Gadhafi not only on humanitarian grounds, but also because Gadhafi has \"American blood on his hands\" from the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. However, just 18 months ago, McCain himself traveled to Tripoli to talk to Gadhafi about a transfer of American military equipment. He also praised the \"remarkable and positive turn\" in U.S.-Libya relations.\\n\\nIt turns out one of the diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks describes in detail the friendly meeting between McCain and Gadhafi. It was also attended by fellow hawks Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham as well as Gadhafi\\'s son, Muatassim. (See video of the meeting here.)\\n\\nKeep in mind the context for the meeting was several years of increasingly warm relations between the U.S. and Libya. In the private talks, Muatassim Gadhafi \"emphasized Libya\\'s interest in the purchase of U.S. lethal and non-lethal military equipment.\" McCain was receptive to that request:\\n\\nMuatassim requested the \"highest level of help possible\" to obtain military supplies, including mobile hospitals and uniforms. He also requested assistance with upgrading Libya\\'s equipment, including helicopters. \"We can get [equipment] from Russia or China, but we want to get it from you as a symbol of faith from the United States,\" he said. He described the security threats that Libya could possibly face as a result of its geography - \"There are 60 million Algerians to the West, 80 million Egyptians to the East, we have Europe in front of us, and we face Sub-Saharan Africa with its problems to the South.\" ... Senator McCain assured Muatassim that the United States wanted to provide Libya with the equipment it needs for its TRIPOLI 00000677 002.2 OF 002 security. He stated that he understood Libya\\'s requests regarding the rehabilitation of its eight C130s (ref D) and pledged to see what he could do to move things forward in Congress. He encouraged Muatassim to keep in mind the long-term perspective of bilateral security engagement and to remember that small obstacles will emerge from time to time that can be overcome.\\n\\nBucky Turco at Animal New York points out that the Pentagon apparently has an expansive definition of \"non-lethal equipment.\" The term encompasses items like shotguns, tear gas canisters and stun grenades.\\n\\nMcCain sent out this memorable tweet after his Gadhafi meeting:\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing contradictory about previously advocating for normalization of relations with Gadhafi and then shifting, in the face of Gadhafi\\'s attacks on rebels, to supporting a bombing campaign. That\\'s not what McCain is doing. He is arguing that Ghadafi needs to be ousted because he has American blood on his hands (from 1988), when the senator himself was meeting with and praising the Libyan regime a mere 18 months ago.',\n",

For so long you taught me I was nothing more than a bad copy of the standard.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t run as fast or lift as much. I didn\\'t make the same money and I cried too often. I grew up in a man\\'s world where I didn\\'t belong.\\n\\nAnd when I couldn\\'t be him, I wanted only to please him. I put on your makeup and wore your short skirts. I gave my life, my body, my dignity, for the cause of being pretty. I knew that no matter what I did, I was worthy only to the degree that I could please and be beautiful for my master. And so I spent my life on the cover of Cosmo and gave my body for you to sell.\\n\\nI was a slave, but you taught me I was free. I was your object, but you swore it was success. You taught me that my purpose in life was to be on display, to attract and be beautiful for men. You had me believe that my body was created to market your cars. And you raised me to think I was an ugly duckling.\\n\\nBut you lied.\\n\\nIslam tells me I\\'m a swan. I\\'m different—it\\'s meant to be that way. And my body, my soul, were created for something more.\\n\\nGod says in the Qur\\'an:\\n\\n{O mankind, We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another (not that you may despise each other). Verily, the most honored of you in the sight of God is the one who is most righteous} (49:13)\\n\\nSo I am honored. But it is not by my relationship to men. My value as a woman is not measured by the size of my waist or the number of men who like me. My worth as a human being is measured on a higher scale: a scale of righteousness and piety. And my purpose in life—despite what the fashion magazines say—is something more sublime than just looking good for men.\\n\\nAnd so God tells me to cover myself, to hide my beauty, and to tell the world that I\\'m not here to please men with my body; I\\'m here to please God. God elevates the dignity of a woman\\'s body by commanding that it be respected and covered, shown only to the deserving—only to the man I marry.\\n\\nSo to those who wish to \"liberate\" me, I have only one thing to say:\\n\\nThanks, but no thanks.\\n\\nI\\'m not here to be on display. And my body is not for public consumption. I will not be reduced to an object or a pair of legs to sell shoes. I\\'m a soul, a mind, a servant of God. My worth is defined by the beauty of my soul, my heart, my moral character. So I won\\'t worship your beauty standards, and I don\\'t submit to your fashion sense. My submission is to something higher.\\n\\nWith my veil I put my faith on display—rather than my beauty. My value as a human is defined by my relationship with God, not by my looks. So I cover the irrelevant. And when you look at me, you don\\'t see a body. You view me only for what I am: a servant of my Creator.\\n\\nSo you see, as a Muslim woman, I\\'ve been liberated from a silent kind of bondage. I don\\'t answer to the slaves of God on earth.

       " 'Due to the fierce competition in the online shopping world, one of the common questions we\\'re asked by clients, is how they can keep control of product pricing.

But once they\\'ve paid, they can then sell at whatever price they deem profitable to them.

But it can be other online resellers complaining too.\\n\\nThe solution (or rather prevention) is MAP\\n\\nWhen we\\'re working with new companies and we\\'re discussing pricing strategy and sales channels - we always bring up their reseller agreements. It can be a dicey conversation, since many eager entrepreneurs will take any order, and don\\'t want to potentially complicate sales with legal agreements. However, the smartest will listen and can understand how implementing reseller agreements from the start will circumvent problems (such as price wars and reseller disputes) later.\\n\\nReseller agreements can be complicated things and its definitely a document you\\'ll need legal counsel to do right. But virtually all of them should stipulate that the reseller agrees to a minimum advertised price.\\n\\nSo what exactly is MAP?\\n\\nA minimum advertised price is just that - it\\'s the agreed price a reseller agrees to advertise a brand or product at. There may be some wiggle room, but generally, when a reseller accepts the agreement, they\\'re stuck. They can\\'t advertise a product for sale any less than the agreed price. This means in print, online, or any where. Of course, this doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t sell the product cheaper, they simply can\\'t display a cheaper price. And well, if the lower price isn\\'t shown, it\\'s hard to discover it.\\n\\nMAP does not equal price fixing\\n\\nWhile collusion to maintain a fixed price or profit margin is illegal in most circumstances MAP policies are legitimate and valid - if done correctly. First, and here\\'s the big differentiator - MAP pricing does not limit the actual selling price. It simply sets the minimum price a product can be advertised at - whether that\\'s in print or online.\\n\\nApple computer is a perfect example of this policy. It\\'s rare that you\\'ll see any sale or larger discounting on Apple products - regardless of the size of the reseller. Apple controls their displayed pricing in two ways. First, their reseller agreements certainly dictate MAP price points - and secondly, they offer slimmer than normal margins to their channels - the later reduces the incentive to discount heavily. They also strictly control the inventory levels dolled out to resellers - to prevent steep discounting or clearance pricing. In fact, one of the few times you\\'ll ever see bargain pricing on Apple products is when a retailer has decided to discontinue selling Apple. But because they\\'re usually not sitting on a large stock pile of inventory, this rarely happens.\\n\\nWhy would a reseller accept MAP?\\n\\nResellers are adverse to risk. They certainly don\\'t want to take on new brands and products that they\\'ll be undercut on by other resellers. They want to have some cost control and profit assurances. MAP affords them some protection. They know that if they buy your product to sell, they won\\'t necessarily see it online tomorrow advertised for way less. Likewise, generally, by accepting MAP the reseller will gain something in return. And this is the important motivator. It may be co-op advertising dollars. It may be exclusivity or specific territories. Or it could simply be better wholesale pricing.\\n\\nWhat about eBay and Amazon?\\n\\nOf course, the \"right of first sale doctrine\" and the abundance of steep discount offers means you\\'ll always find \"deals\" online. Steeply discounted products that don\\'t adhere to your MAP - and probably don\\'t have to. For instance, if you or a reseller, offer a promotional discount, perhaps buy one get one free (BOGO) - you\\'ll get savvy shoppers that scoop up these deals and then resell the products at a discount. And since they\\'re working with virtually no overhead, they may be willing to live on a few dollars of profit.\\n\\nOur advice to clients in this area is usually two-fold. First, limit or at least monitor these types of sales and promotional offers. If you make such an offer and a customer suddenly orders dozens of them, there\\'s a good chance they\\'ll be on eBay in the',\n",
       " 'Even as Congress has begun the process to repeal Obamacare, Americans continue to seek coverage through its insurance exchanges.\\n\\nMore than 11.5 million people have signed up for coverage through the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, and the 12 state-based exchanges, as of Dec. 24, according to federal data released Tuesday. That\\'s 286,000 more than the comparable time a year ago.\\n\\nThe number of people opting for Obamacare is under more scrutiny than usual this year, since President-elect Trump and Congressional Republicans have vowed to repeal it soon after he takes office on Jan. 20. Initial efforts, however, are already running into resistance, with some GOP members wanting to wait until a replacement plan is ready before voting to repeal.\\n\\nThough the Trump administration takes control late next week, current Health & Human Services officials laid out a plan to further boost sign ups through Jan. 31, which marks the end of open enrollment. The agency is airing television and radio ads, sending targeted emails to potential customers and reaching out via YouTube and other social media channels -- continuing outreach efforts that have been underway during this enrollment season.\\n\\nThe Internal Revenue Service is also contacting those who paid a penalty for remaining uninsured. The agency recently announced that about 6.5 million Americans had to pay the penalty, typically $330, in 2015. That\\'s less than the roughly 8 million who were penalized in 2014.\\n\\nHigh on the list of targets is younger Americans, who typically are healthier and have lower health care expenses. However, they still make up only 26% of those signing up on the federal exchange to date, the same as last year.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear whether the marketing efforts will continue under Trump, who has vowed to repeal President Obama\\'s signature health reform law.\\n\\nStill, Obama and his officials continue to make a case for Obamacare.\\n\\n\"In access, quality and affordability, the Affordable Care Act has helped us make real progress for families across the nation,\" said Health Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Monday.\\n\\nThe Obama administration expects a total of 13.8 million people to sign up for plans by the end of the enrollment period, which began Nov. 1. However, it\\'s common for people to drop their policies during the course of the year because they find coverage elsewhere, either through a job or a spouse. So, an average of 11.4 million people are expected to be in Obamacare policies during 2017.\\n\\nConsumers aren\\'t officially enrolled until they pay their first month\\'s premium.\\n\\nRelated: GOP worried about Obamacare plan\\n\\nEven before the election, there were concerns that prospective enrollees would be deterred by price hikes -- the average premium for the benchmark silver plan soared 22% for 2017 -- and the fact that some insurers had pulled out of the exchanges.\\n\\nMost enrollees, however, are shielded from those increases by federal subsidies. Some 82% of people who have signed up for 2017 plans are eligible for subsidies, according to Health & Human Services Department officials. The average subsidy for those enrolling on the federal exchange is $4,600 a year.\\n\\nConsumers are also shopping around for coverage. Some 56% of returning customers actively selected plan, up from 51% a year ago. Those who opt not to shop are automatically re-enrolled in their existing policy.',\n",

The more loans that pass through its network, the more money that LendingClub nets without putting more immediate risk onto its books — a neat mechanism.\\n\\nAccording to the S-1, LendingClub receives between 1 percent and 6 percent of the principal amount of loaned monies. Also, LendingClub charges investors a small percent — around 1, but variable — management fee, and takes a roughly 1 percent servicing fee on transacted payments.\\n\\nAccording to CrunchBase, LendingClub has previously raised $392.9 million in venture capital over the course of 12 rounds — the company\\'s most recent capital infusion, $65 million, touched down in April of this year.

       " \"Is Harley-Davidson's venerable Panhead the best looking motorcycle engine of all time? It's certainly up there with the Triumph and Moto Guzzi twins. It's nearly half a century since the last Panhead rolled off the production line, but its appeal has never waned. It's a hit with both customizers and restorers, so we're spoilt for choice with this Top 5.\\n\\nThe 'Pan' was the mainstay of Milwaukee's production from 1948 until the mid 60s. It fixed many of the problems that afflicted its predecessor, the Knuckle, with oil-tight aluminum heads and chrome-plated rocker covers.\\n\\nFor some folks, the Pan has never been bettered. You can even buy a lookalike motor from S&S: It's designed to slot into a post-1970 Harley chassis and will cost you a cool $8,000.\\n\\nFor this round-up, though, we're focusing on custom Panheads that keep the retro vibe but crank up the style.

An eye for a line seems to come with that territory, and Matt's 1959 Panhead is super-clean. It's running a rebuilt motor boosted to 93 ci and a 4-speed 'box with suicide shift. The heavy-set looks of a stock Pan have gone, thanks to a rigid frame, a Springer front end and straight-shootin' custom pipes. Matt fabricated the narrow bars, foot controls and rear fender himself, giving the Harley a timeless, classic look.

He focuses on twins, whether Moto Guzzi, Ducati or Harley, and rides his bikes hard along the highways and backroads of New South Wales. He built this 1950 Pan for a friend, meticulously re-welding the frame and then grafting on a Kawasaki tank and Yamaha rear fender.

Denmark is also home to James Roper-Caldbeck, an Englishman who specializes in rebuilding vintage Harleys. In Europe, word has spread far and wide about his skills, and this 1948 Pan was commissioned by a Romanian enthusiast living in Germany. The need to pass strict German legislation resulted in a low-key build, but it still oozes style—from the Springer front end to the rear fender, which was crafted from a 1930 Ford spare wheel carrier. In between is a thoroughly overhauled and reconfigured machine, with neat touches like cloth-covered wiring and a subtly cut-and-shut tank.

This 'garage-built' Panhead caught the attention of virtually every custom magazine in the States last year; it's not a radical build, but it's beautifully proportioned and finished. Tyler cleaned up the frame, TIG welded any blemishes, and fitted a rigid rear section, a stretched neck and Triumph forks.

       " 'When you think of Elder Scrolls and questing you immediately go into the exploration mode. Turn and run off in a random direction and you are guaranteed to find some lost ruin or dungeon. However, even the great RPG behemoth known as Skyrim has directions and quests to move the player through multiple story lines. Elder Scrolls Online has a similar approach. The team wanted to add in exploration to the zones and the game, but hey also have quests in to guide players through the zone pick up some valuable loot at low levels and to tell an overall story. We wanted to talk a little about how questing works in the game and what players can expect.\\n\\nadvertisement advertisement\\n\\nWe got to play Daggerfall with the demo this past week. The opening zone has a quest line where you are helping some pirates put together a crew to get off this island under the thumb of an evil warlord. I don\\'t want to give the story away, so that is all you get in terms of spoilers. There is a main quest line to find three crew members around the island and reunite them with the captain.\\n\\nQuests begin with cutaways to the character talking directly to you on screen. It is easy to get through and you can talk as much or as little as you want. Like any Elder Scrolls game you are given dialogue choices. You can get the main theme of the quest and say goodbye, or you can continue with more information during the conversation. I will admit that I am not a huge fan of cut scenes, however in Elder Scrolls Online they are not intrusive. The game does not center around the dialogue and you can still get the quest information and move on quickly. You can also get more information on the quests if you want to continue chatting through all of the options.\\n\\nAs you move through the zones there are a lot of quest areas that open up to you. Everything is very clearly marked on your map so it is easy to navigate. As you enter one of the areas in the main quest you will see other quests pop up in the zone to finish if you want. One of the journalists at the demo only did the main quest line and quickly moved to the next zone. I continued to find smaller quests that I wanted to do and pursued those instead. It took me longer to get through the zone, but I am also the completionist sort of player.\\n\\nSo the big question is what happens if you do not really \"pick up\" quests? There are fail safes built into the zones so that you will move through the content and get to the next areas. This is not as big a deal once you get out of the starter zone. The other important thing I noticed is that there are no \"kill ten rats\" quests at all, at least not in the starting zone. The quest lines are more centered around story and not about grinding some arbitrary number. Overall, it has more of an RPG feel than many MMOs do.\\n\\nThere is another very important element in Elder Scrolls Online questing: how you accomplish your goals. The team feels very strongly about giving you multiple ways to achieve your quest objectives. On one hand you are given a disguise to wear and travel through a pirate camp. This allows you to avoid all of the fights along the way. If you are more of a bash \\'em style player you can just charge in and fight your way through the camp. You can also sneak around the NPCs to reach your objectives. There were multiple ways to get the quests done throughout the entire opening zone. I know the team is all about this dynamic and it is great for the players. At one point I was fighting everything I saw in the camp. Then I had to run back through to complete a quest and I did not want to have to fight so I put on the disguise. It made it much easier to move quickly. Having multiple options to complete your goals is definitely one of the best parts of questing in ESO.\\n\\nAt MMORPG.com we have talked a lot about quest design. I think one thing that Elder Scrolls gets right is that you do not feel like you\\'re just grinding quests, at least not early on. It really does capture the RPG feeling of games like Skyrim where you can pick multiple paths, go on different adventures and you never feel like you are in a hamster wheel. The question will be how it plays out at higher levels, and whether the developers will run out of ways to keep things interesting for the PVE adventurers among us.',\n",
       " 'You need the Real Audio player to hear this which you can download for free . If it still doesn\\'t work try this link .\\n\\nMost people have heard of Murphy\\'s Law. But most people, when they\\'re referring to Murphy\\'s Law, are actually referring to the rather pessimistic Finagle\\'s Law, which is \"Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\"\\n\\nMurphy\\'s Law is quite different, and is actually a message of hope. Not only does it warn you about what things can go wrong, it\\'ll even tell you how you can work around them, so as to make it impossible for Murphy\\'s Law to actually happen.\\n\\nNow the AeroSpace industry, where things move very rapidly under very harsh and extreme conditions, is an unforgiving environment. And that\\'s where Murphy\\'s Law was first invented.\\n\\nIn 1949, the US Air Force was running a test series (Project MX981) to see what sort of acceleration (or G-forces) a human being could withstand. They were using a volunteer strapped into a rocket sled at what is now called Edward\\'s Air Force Base, in California. The sled would accelerate up to about 1,000 kilometres per hour, and then stop suddenly. One of the volunteer human torpedoes was Colonel Stapp, who was also a medical doctor.\\n\\nNow our hero, Air Force Captain Edward A. Murphy Jnr., had designed a harness which strapped onto the volunteer. This harness held 16 sensors to measure the acceleration, or the G-forces, on different parts of the poor volunteer. As luck would have it, there were two ways that each sensor could be installed.\\n\\nThe rocket sled took off, and stopped suddenly, generating 40 Gs. Under 1 G, the average person weighs about 70 kg, but under 40 Gs, they weigh 40 times more - about 2.8 tonnes. 40 Gs is an enormous amount of acceleration - enough to push your ears onto the front of your head.\\n\\nAt the end of the experiment Colonel Stapp staggered off the rocket sled with blood-shot eyes and bleeds from a number of bodily orifices. When he looked at the results, he wasn\\'t very happy - all the sensors registered zero! He called for Captain Murphy, who examined the sled - and found that every single one of those 16 sensors had been installed the wrong way round. Colonel Stapp had been strained in vain.\\n\\nIn a voice like thunder, Edward A. Murphy Jnr. proclaimed, \"If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that way\". This is the true and original form of Murphy\\'s Law.\\n\\nOf course, you have to notice that little word, \"If\" in \"If there are two or more ways......\". Suppose that there\\'s only one way. For example, if you design something that can be installed only one way, then it can\\'t be put in the wrong way.\\n\\nConsider 240 V electrical power. You definitely don\\'t want the full 240V power to jump directly to any of the other wires. So look at your standard 3-pin 240V electrical power plug. It\\'s not symmetrical. There\\'s only one way to insert it into a 240V electrical power socket.\\n\\nBut sometimes, it doesn\\'t matter which way a thing goes in, so long as it goes in. So another way around Murphy\\'s Law is to design something so that it doesn\\'t matter which way it goes in.\\n\\nConsider the key.\\n\\nYour average car key has equal bumps on both sides, so it doesn\\'t matter whether you put it in one way or the other - it always works. But your house key has bumps only on one side - this means that half the time, you\\'ll put it in the wrong way. I guess it\\'s an example of Murphy\\'s Law that after half a century after Murphy\\'s Law was first discovered, the house key manufacturers still haven\\'t heard of it.\\n\\nSo once he had realised the message of Murphy\\'s Law, Murphy himself redesigned the G-force sensors so that they could be installed only one way - and that particular problem was solved.\\n\\nThe next day Murphy\\'s Law was officially declared at a Press Conference about the rocket sled test. A few months later Murphy\\'s Law began to be mentioned in AeroSpace manufacturer\\'s advertisements, and finally by the Flight Safety Foundation. As Murphy\\'s Law spread across the planet, two things happened - people forgot that there was a real person called Murphy, and the Law got modified into the pessimistic form of \"If anything can go wrong, it will go wrong\".\\n\\nThe fact that many people confuse the optimistic Murphy\\'s Law for the pessimistic Finagle\\'s Law, is proof that Murphy\\'s Law can even act upon itself.',\n",

It\\'s very Neon Indian: old and new technologies coming together in a sly but seemingly sincere way, with throwback results that keep the prospect of a party in mind.\\n\\n\"Slumlord,\" the song triggered by the phone call, is big and bright in a manner that peers back to Neon Indian\\'s chillwave roots but with a newer — and bigger and brighter — sense of scale. The beat is thwacking and spacious, its disco ambiance aided by a bulbous bassline and a gaggle of synthesizers in arpeggiated action. There\\'s a lot going on, and its antic metabolism carries over to much of the album, Neon Indian\\'s third since breaking out in 2009 and its first since 2011\\'s Era Extraña.\\n\\nAfter a brief, roiling electronic intro, \"Annie\" kicks off the album in earnest with a laid-back quasi-reggae vibe that evokes contemporaries like Peaking Lights as well as throwbacks from The English Beat to Men At Work. The sleek, colorful electronic tinge of it all makes for a sound far better than the notion of \"quasi-reggae\" might suggest, and it introduces \\'80s-mining inclinations that are never too distant in the mix. \"Street Level\" follows in the style of a strange, sloshing pop song that seems to have more sounds clamoring within it than any one song could contain, before \"Smut!\" clears out a bit in favor of an airier, more leisurely groove.\\n\\nThe vocals of Neon Indian chief Alan Palomo sound smeary and diaphanous throughout, with occasional falsetto rises that tip toward Prince but more often strike a wandering tone that favors suggestive impressions of feelings more than clear words. (\"Neoprene\" and \"magazine\" figure in \"Smut!\" in a way that seems significant.) Within the mix of so many other animated sounds at play, the voice takes its place as just another presence at a party worth crashing.\\n\\nNeon Indian has also created a psychedelic video for the entire album.

       " 'There are two ways to support Buddhism. One is known as amisapuja, supporting through material offerings. These are the four supports of food, clothing, shelter and medicine. The act of amisapuja supports Buddhism by giving material offerings to the sangha of monks and nuns, enabling them to live in reasonable comfort for the practice of dhamma. This fosters the direct realization of the Buddha\\'s teaching, in turn bringing continued prosperity to the Buddhist religion.\\n\\nBuddhism can be likened to a tree. A tree has roots, a trunk, branches, twigs, and leaves. The leaves and branches depend on the roots to absorb nutriment from the soil. The words we speak are like branches and leaves, which depend on a root—the mind—to absorb nutriment and send it out to them. These limbs in turn carry the fruit as our speech and actions. Whatever state the mind is in, skillful or unskillful, it expresses that quality outwardly through our actions and speech.\\n\\nTherefore the support of Buddhism through the practical application of the teachings is the most important kind of support. For example, in the ceremony of taking the precepts on observance days, the teacher describes those unskillful actions that should be avoided. But if you simply go through the ceremony of taking the precepts without reflecting on their meaning, progress is difficult. You will be unable to find the true practice. The real support of Buddhism must therefore be done through patipattipuja, the \"offering\" of practice, cultivating true restraint, concentration and wisdom. Then you will know what Buddhism is all about. If you don\\'t understand through practice, you\\'ll never know, even if you learn the whole Tipitaka.\\n\\nIn the time of the Buddha there was a monk known as Tuccho Pothila. This monk was one of the Buddha\\'s most learned disciples, thoroughly versed in the scriptures and texts. He was so famous that he was revered by people everywhere and had eighteen monasteries under his care. When people heard the name \" Tuccho Pothila\" they were awestruck, and nobody would dare question anything he taught, so much did they revere his command of the teachings.\\n\\nOne day he went to pay respects to the Buddha. As he was paying his respects, the Buddha said, \"Ah, hello, Venerable Empty Scripture!\" Just like that! They conversed for a while until it was time to go, and then, as he was taking leave of the Buddha, the Buddha said, \"Oh, leaving now, Venerable Empty Scripture?\"\\n\\nThat was what the Buddha said. On arriving, \"Oh, hello, Venerable Empty Scripture.\" When it was time to go, \"Ah, leaving now, Venerable Empty Scripture?\" That was the teaching the Buddha gave. Tuccho Pothila was puzzled, \"Why did the Buddha say that? What did he mean?\" He thought and thought, turning over everything he had learned, until eventually he realized, \"It\\'s true ! \\'Venerable Empty Scripture\\'—that\\'s me, a monk who studies but doesn\\'t practice.\" When he looked into his heart he saw that really he was no different from lay people. Whatever they aspired to, he also aspired to; whatever they enjoyed, he also enjoyed. There was no real samana within him, no truly profound quality capable of firmly establishing him in the Noble Way and providing true peace.\\n\\nSo he decided to practice. But there was nowhere for him to go to. All the teachers around were his own students. No one would dare accept him. Usually when people meet their teacher they become timid and deferential, and so no one would dare to become his teacher.\\n\\nFinally he went to see a certain young novice who was enlightened and asked to practice under him. The novice said, \"Yes, sure you can practice with me, but only if you\\'re sincere. If you\\'re not sincere then I won\\'t accept you.\" Tuccho Pothila pledged himself as a student of the novice.\\n\\nThe novice then told him to put on all his robes. Now there happened to be a muddy bog nearby. When Tuccho Pothila had carefully put on all his robes—expensive ones they were, too—the novice said, \"Okay, now run down into that bog. If I don\\'t tell you to stop, don\\'t stop. If I don\\'t tell you to come out, don\\'t come out. Okay…run!\"\\n\\nTuccho Pothila, neatly robed, plunged into the bog. The novice didn\\'t tell him to stop until he was completely covered in mud. Finally the novice said, \"You can stop now.\" So he stopped. \"Okay, come on up!\" And he came out.\\n\\nClearly Tuccho Pothila had given up his pride. He was ready to accept the teaching. If',\n",

       " 'Earlier today, President Obama held a press conference to address the growing public concern over the National Security Agency\\'s surveillance practices. We are glad to see that the Administration has been forced to address the matter publicly as a result of the sustained public pressure from concerned voters as well as the ongoing press coverage of this issue. Obama acknowledged that Americans were uncomfortable with the surveillance that has been leaked to the media (and noted that he would be as well, if he weren\\'t in the government). He made four commitments to transparency and reform during the press conference, and also published a whitepaper describing the legal interpretation of the PATRIOT Act that is used to attempt to justify bulk surveillance.\\n\\nWhile we\\'re glad Obama is responding to the public\\'s concerns, we take Obama\\'s promises today with a healthy dose of skepticism. He may be paying lip service to accountability and transparency, but the devil will be in the details when it comes to whether his proposals will be effective.\\n\\nOther promises aside, President Obama did not commit to reducing the surveillance of Americans\\' communications or the communications of individuals abroad who are not suspected of any crime.\\n\\nObama\\'s 4 Commitments – And What\\'s Missing\\n\\nObama made 4 specific commitments around NSA surveillance. Here\\'s an overview of what he did – and did not – promise to do.\\n\\n1. Obama will work with Congress to \"pursue appropriate reforms to Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\" This is the subsection of law used to justify the bulk collection of telephone records. Several bills have been introduced this Congress that attempt to tighten up this law, and we\\'re glad to see Obama will be supportive of such efforts. However, Obama pointedly did not address Sec. 702, the other statute that the government has cited as supporting its broader surveillance, including the content of communications. And as we\\'ve explained, to return Americans to the rule of law and privacy and free speech rights that they deserve, we\\'ll need changes well beyond Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. And even as to 215, Obama failed to explain what \"appropriate reforms\" might look like. Read what EFF thinks should be in NSA reform legislation.\\n\\n2. Obama will work with Congress to improve public confidence in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) by creating a public advocate that can defend privacy in the court. We were pleased that Obama specifically promised \"to make sure civil liberties concerns have an independent voice, in appropriate cases, by ensuring that the government\\'s position is challenged by an adversary\" in the extremely secretive FISC. This could be a powerful reform, and one we would wholeheartedly support (especially, for example, if organizations like EFF can serve as the adversary on occasion). However, whether this is actually implemented in a meaningful way remains to be seen. A public advocate in the FISC should be involved in every proceeding, not just \"in appropriate cases.\" Furthermore, that advocate would need full access to the materials the government will be using in presenting its case to the judge. And finally, we remain concerned that this position will be subject to capture unless it has at least the sort of independence and protections that public defenders enjoy.\\n\\n3. Obama has directed the intelligence community \"to make public as much information about these programs as possible.\" First, \"these programs\" must include \"all surveillance programs,\" not just those that have been leaked so far. The NSA is supposed to put in place a full time civil liberties and privacy officer and create a website that details its surveillance practices. This should have happened long ago, though we think this is a step in the right direction. However, any such website must actually provide real answers about surveillance rather than obfuscations and word games.\\n\\n4. Obama is creating a \"high level group of outside experts to review our entire intelligence and communications technologies.\" This group will be tasked with creating an interim report in 60 days and a final report by the end of the year that should address the impact of surveillance technologies, including potential abuses as well as the impact on foreign policy. We\\'re not certain whether Obama is planning on having the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board fulfill this role or whether he is planning on creating a new board, but it is very clear that any group of experts will struggle to have independence, adequate subpoena power, resources and staff time, as well as the political clout necessary to have a meaningful impact on our current surveillance regime. We hope that Obama ensures that this expert board has the information it needs to do its job.\\n\\nWhile we were skeptical about other aspects of the press conference, we were pleased to see Obama acknowledge the benefits of privacy enhancing technology. He stated that \"[T]echnology itself may provide us some additional safeguards. So for example, if people don\\'t have confidence that the law, the checks and balances of the court and Congress, are sufficient to give us confidence that government\\'s not snooping, well, maybe we can embed technologies in there that prevent the snooping regardless of what government wants to do. I mean, there may be some technological',\n",

This helped them search other e-mail accounts owned by Broadwell, including a Gmail account she used, which led them to the affair with Petraeus, according to The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nThe case shows just how easy it is to discover the personal connections that can unmask anonymous parties. But the Petraeus affair is as much an outlier as an exemplar. The FBI rarely, if ever, gets involved when one person is harassing another online.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not aware of any case when the FBI has gotten involved in a case of online harassment,\" Justin Patchin, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, said. \"The FBI definitely wouldn\\'t get involved in your Joe Schmoe love triangle.\"\\n\\nThe affair began to unravel after the Florida woman, Jill Kelley, contacted an FBI friend after receiving threatening and harassing e-mails from an anonymous person who accused her of flirting with a man who was not identified in the e-mails. Kelley is a volunteer social planner for events at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, which is home to the military\\'s Central Command. Petraeus was commander of CENTCOM from 2008 to 2010, when he left to take his position as head of the CIA.The e-mails, between 5 and 10 of them, began arriving last May, and reportedly told Kelley to \"back off\" and \"stay away\" from the unnamed man.\\n\\nKelley\\'s FBI friend launched an investigation to determine if the threatening e-mails constituted a cybercrime.\\n\\nFBI investigators determined that the anonymous account from which the e-mails were sent belonged to Broadwell and her husband, who live in North Carolina. Reports are unclear about how they did this, but, according to the New York Times investigators were able to determine what other e-mail accounts had been accessed from the same computer address as the one that sent the harassing e-mails, which may have led them to Broadwell or her husband.\\n\\nThe information contained in the metadata of e-mail headers varies. It\\'s unclear if the anonymous account was a Gmail account or came from another e-mail service provider. In Gmail, the header generally only includes the IP address and domains of the servers through which the e-mail was sent, as well as ones it passed through in transit to the recipient\\'s inbox. Authorities would have had to contact Google to obtain information about the IP address that was used to log into the anonymous account and any other accounts that were accessed from the same address. But other e-mail providers, such as Yahoo, do include the sender IP address in the metadata.\\n\\nAgents considered that the anonymous e-mail account used to send the harassing e-mails might have been hacked by someone else who was sending the e-mails to Kelley. But they eventually were able to match the locations from which the e-mails were sent to the same locations, including hotels, where Broadwell was known to have been during the times the correspondence was set to Kelley, according to the Journal.\\n\\nBased on these connections, investigators obtained a warrant to monitor other e-mail accounts Broadwell used, including a Gmail account.\\n\\nIn examining these other accounts, agents uncovered sexually explicit e-mails that Broadwell exchanged with another party who also used a Gmail account. Investigators were not able to immediately identify Petraeus as the other party, however, because he\\'d set up his Gmail account using a pseudonym.\\n\\nInvestigators determined sometime during mid-summer that it belonged to Petraeus and that the two were having an affair. The reports do not say how investigators made that connection. According to the New York Times it\\'s not known if the FBI gained access to Petraeus\\' personal e-mail account, or if its investigation relied solely on e-mails found in Broadwell\\'s account.\\n\\nBroadwell\\'s affair with Petraeus reportedly began two months after he took over the CIA and ended about four months ago, around the same time the FBI discovered the affair, according to Col. Steven Boylan, who spoke to ABC News.\\n\\nAfter the FBI contacted Broadwell the week of Oct. 21, she acknowledged the affair and provided authorities with her computer.

       " '(Amy King/The Washington Post; iStock)\\n\\nMelinda Gates, the philanthropist and mother of three, gathered from listening to her kids and their friends that the next generation of American spouses expects to evenly split the household chores.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry to say this, but if you think that, you\\'re wrong,\" she wrote to high schoolers Monday in her annual open letter, co-penned with her husband Bill Gates. \"Unless things change, girls today will spend hundreds of thousands more hours than boys doing unpaid work simply because society assumes it\\'s their responsibility.\"\\n\\nShe backed her case with global data. Women worldwide devote an average of 4.5 hours each day to unpaid work — cooking, cleaning, changing the baby\\'s diaper. Men contribute less than half that much time, according to the OECD.\\n\\nThe domestic division of labor remains staggeringly unbalanced in the United States, where female breadwinners now support 40 percent of homes. Women here typically spend two hours and 12 minutes daily on housework, while men spend one hour and 21 minutes.\\n\\n[The best age to get married if you don\\'t want to get divorced]\\n\\nA 2015 survey by Working Mom, furthermore, found that female breadwinners who lived with male partners still reported handling the bulk of grocery shopping, meal preparation, bill-paying and cleaning.\\n\\n\"This isn\\'t a global plot by men to oppress women,\" Melinda wrote. \"It\\'s more subtle than that. The division of work depends on cultural norms, and we call them norms because they seem normal — so normal that many of us don\\'t notice the assumptions we\\'re making. But your generation can notice them — and keep pointing them out until the world pays attention.\"\\n\\n(Bill, it should be noted, drives their kids to school every other day.)\\n\\nMelinda is right about cultural norms in America and beyond. Even after moms could vote and become chief executives and run for president, dads maintained their status as primary provider status in popular culture.\\n\\nConsider Fusion\\'s new breakdown of the Oscar-winning actresses through the years: Most have played wives.\\n\\nThe wife penalty\\n\\nOf course, that\\'s a highly simplified explanation for why one sex shoulders more unpaid work. And it\\'s not to say all women feel trapped in motherhood and the associated duties.\\n\\nBut, as Gates points out, for women who want to excel in their careers, the disproportionate load can create an unfair penalty. Men, it turns out, might be holding their partners back when they don\\'t share non-work tasks.\\n\\nMothers in the United States who work full time, year round, make an average of $40,000, compared to $56,999 paid to fathers, according to the National Women\\'s Law Center. That\\'s 70 cents to the dollar.\\n\\nEconomists say this disparity probably comes from a blend of factors: Women are sometimes \"mommy tracked,\" or passed over for high-profile projects or promotions, when employers assume motherhood (but not fatherhood) zaps productivity. A 2015 study from the University of Georgia found that, for this reason, expectant mothers are often afraid to tell their bosses they\\'re pregnant.\\n\\nWomen do take more time off to tend to family, but that\\'s not always a choice. Sometimes, as the data shows, husbands just don\\'t pull their domestic weight. They also tend to prioritize their careers over their wives\\', while wives tend to equally prioritize both partners\\' careers, according to a 2014 study of 25,000 Harvard Business School graduates.\\n\\nThe lesbian wage premium\\n\\nEvidence for the wife (or husband) penalty shows up in what researchers call the \"lesbian wage premium.\" Across years of research, women who have never lived with a male partner make more money than women who have.\\n\\nLast year, Marieka Klawitter, professor of public policy at the University of Washington, examined 29 studies across the Western Hemisphere on wages and sexual orientation and found a 9 percent earnings premium for lesbians over heterosexual women. (Gay men, meanwhile, faced an 11 percent penalty, compared to straight men.)\\n\\nShe controlled for parenthood and concluded lesbians simply had more education and work experience than the general female population.\\n\\n[The U.S. is still divided on what causes homosexuality]\\n\\nBut another study from the University of Nevada, which used national data from the year 2000, adds a stunning asterisk to Klawitter\\'s findings: Lesbians who had previously lived with male partners made 9.5 percent less than those who\\'d never cohabitated with a husband figure.\\n\\nWere men actually the drags on women\\'s earnings?\\n\\nAfter controlling for characteristics like education and experience, the authors found a 6.6 percent premium for cohabiting lesbians over cohabiting heterosexual women, with the premium falling to 5.2 percent if the lesbians had ever been married to a man.\\n\\n(Still, two-women',\n",
       " \"I got chatting with a bloke on Waikiki Beach recently. A Collingwood supporter who wanted to talk about the state of the game. 'Roosy,' he said, 'what do you see as the biggest problems facing footy, and how would you fix them?'\\n\\nI didn't go to Hawaii to talk about footy. But this got me thinking. About all the meetings I'd been in with AFL executives like Adrian Anderson, Andrew Demetriou and Gillon McLachlan during my years as a coach. About so many conversations focused on the integrity of the competition. What I believed then I'm even more convinced of now: that footy's integrity is compromised.\\n\\nThe first thing we need to do is to leave the rules alone. There's been too much tinkering and too much change. So let's just take a deep breath, let the rules settle, and leave the game as is for the next year four or five years, until the next broadcast deal starts in 2023.\\n\\nThe game itself is in really good shape. It's even, because the equalisation mechanisms are kicking in after years of compromised drafts. It's good to watch, and thankfully no-one's talking about flooding now, or stoppages. So leave it be – and, while we're at it, keep the interchange system as it is and the Grand Final on Saturday afternoon, too.\\n\\nBut there are problems. There are five issues compromising the AFL that have been bubbling for years, some for decades, and there's also a relative newcomer to the debate: the need to deal with concussion and its ramifications so that the game's welfare keeps pace with the players.\\n\\nDRAW EQUALITY\\n\\nThe draw's not fair. We all know it. You could be playing the five bottom teams twice. You could be playing the five top teams twice. I don't subscribe to the 17-5 model that's been mooted, I think it's ridiculous, so what is the fairest draw model for the integrity of the competition? What's fairest is that you play everyone twice, home and away, but you're never going to have a 34-week season. So what's the next best option?\\n\\nThe players obviously want to spend less time at clubs, and I actually spoke to a high-profile player last year when I was coaching Melbourne and I said, 'Would you take less money if there was only 17 rounds?' He said, 'Yeah, I would'.\\n\\nSo, 17 rounds. Play each other once: home one year and away the other. Two byes stretch it to 19 weeks, and instead of the pre-finals week off I would have a 'wildcard' play-off round where it's seven-versus-ten and eight-versus-nine. So the bottom eight are finished, teams one to six get the week off, and then, bang, you go into the finals series of eight as we know it.\\n\\nBut there are problems. There are five issues compromising the AFL that have been bubbling for years, some for decades.\\n\\nThat stretches the season for the broadcasters, gives the players the two byes they want, gives the top six an extra bye, but also gives the 10th placed team a sneaky chance to play finals. There will be issues with broadcasters and that's why it needs to happen at the end of the current TV rights deal – clearly there's obstacles around how you'd get it done. But one of the biggest impediments to our game now is it started off as 12 teams playing each other twice, so 22 rounds. In an 18-team competition, there are soft draws and hard draws and we need a fairer, more equitable system.\\n\\nHow resistant will the AFL's broadcast partners be, given that they're tipping in more than $2 billion over six years for what they get now? If they're paying what they're paying now, then they're going to want 23 rounds, but if they're saying, 'Well, we'll pay less', and the players say, 'Well, we'll take less', who knows? Clearly there's some issues around it, but I'd love to think that the powers-that-be can sit down and work it out, because the fixture won't be fair until they do.\\n\\nRAISE THE DRAFT AGE\\n\\nThis is one I've been very strong about, for multiple reasons. Probably the main one is when kids are doing Year 12 we shouldn't be asking them to do under 18 championships, TAC Cup, club football, school football, and their final year of school all at the same time. Then suddenly you might be on the plane to Perth when you've lived in Ballarat and your Mum and Dad have looked after you and your whole life's been relocated. I think the minimum draft age needs to be at least a year older.\\n\\nAs it is, the gap that\",\n",
       " 'Disclaimer\\n\\nBefore I start, let me make a few things very clear. I believe hitting a woman is a despicable act, as a husband, I can\\'t imagine a situation where I would do so, and as a father, I would absolutely destroy any \"man\" who put his hands on my 4-year-old daughter, or my son if he ever even had the thought of doing so to any woman. I believe that our justice system was designed around a single premise: that everyone is \"innocent until proven guilty\" ... however, that through time, there are certain acts, like domestic violence, where our societal views have begun to default immediately to guilt, and place the burden of proof, unfairly, on the accused. We view many of these types of cases as black-and-white, open-and-shut. ... Casting these individuals as horrible human beings who don\\'t deserve to breathe, and the only picture of \"justice\" involves them paying mightily for their actions. I believe that there are certain situations in which those feelings inevitably influence the actions of those in law enforcement as well as the judicial system. ... Thus bringing about the importance of a trial by jury, and unanimous verdicts. Certain people, including Dallas\\' own Dale Hansen of WFAA Channel 8 have adopted the view that Hardy is without a doubt, guilty, and Mr. Hansen declared so in his statements regarding the Dallas Cowboys this week. ( Our complete coverage of Hardy/Cowboys angles is collected here.)\\n\\n\\nHansen\\'s \"unplugged\\'\\' piece from Wednesday is seen above. His Thursday roundtable featuring our own Mike Fisher is here.\\n\\n\\nThe purpose of this piece is not to declare Greg Hardy to be innocent or guilty of the actions of which he was accused; it is simply to provide as true a picture as possible of the events that took place, their context, and their aftermath, to allow you (the reader) to come to your own conclusion.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nHardy came into the NFL with questions about his off-field behavior, after being suspended for two games by the University of Mississippi for missing meetings and breaking team rules, and even kicked off the team before being reinstated. However, Tyrone Nix, Hardy\\'s defensive coordinator at Ole Miss told the Charlotte Observer that Hardy never had any incidence involving violence towards women in his time there, and that he \"has always been a guy of high character, as far as respect to others.\" Prior to the incident in question, Hardy\\'s criminal record consisted only of traffic violations, including speeding, on operator\\'s license (waived), window-tinting violation (waived), and driving without registration (waived).\\n\\nHardy and the alleged victim, Nicole Holder, entered a romantic relationship in September 2013, the start of Hardy\\'s finest year of professional football, while Holder was employed as a waitress at a Charlotte nightclub. They remained in a relationship which a friend of Holder described as \"really good, really bad, with nothing in between\" until they broke up in February 2014, although they did stay in contact and occasionally engage intimately.\\n\\nAfter the couple split, Holder entered a brief relationship with the rapper Nelly, which had upset Hardy, but by the time of the incident in question, they were trying to \"reconcile the relationship.\"\\n\\nOn May 10, 2014, two nights before the incident in question, Holder was seen following Hardy out of her place of employment, The Epicenter nightclub in Charlotte, crying and blocking his car from leaving. Security guards involved the police after Holder kicked the door of Hardy\\'s car.\\n\\nThe night of the incident\\n\\nThe night of May 12, 2014, Hardy, and Holder, along with Hardy\\'s assistant and other friends, went out drinking. Holder later admitted to snorting cocaine that night, although a co-worker enacted her Fifth Amendment rights when asked about taking cocaine with Holder that night. After a night of partying, including Hardy getting upset when a Nelly song was played in one of the clubs they visited, they returned to Hardy\\'s apartment and continued to party.\\n\\nThe 9-1-1 Calls: At approximately 4:18 a.m., Hardy made a call to 9-1-1, in which he stated the following: That Holder had hit him in the face twice, and wouldn\\'t leave the apartment, and that she told him to break her arm when he asked her to leave. Hardy\\'s assistant was trying to retain her but she was attempting to his Hardy with a shoe. Hardy stated that she wouldn\\'t let him close the door to the apartment and that he \"can\\'t touch her to get her out\". That he was trying to stay away from her, and that he was behind the bar, and wasn\\'t touching her, but that she had broken some glass and he couldn\\'t walk through his kitchen. Additionally he repeatedly asked \"What do I do?\" When asked if he needed a medic he stated that he was \"a little swollen\" but didn\\'t notice',\n",

       " \"F1 driver penalty points: Who has picked up most sanctions in 2016?\\n\\nStewards' investigations into incidents between drivers on track and other misdemeanours have become increasingly commonplace in F1, with different totting-up procedures in place to deter repeat offenders.\\n\\nWith the 2016 season entering its final races, we take a look at how the tables for driver penalty points and reprimands stands…\\n\\nDriver penalty points\\n\\nSince 2014, F1 has had a penalty points system in place akin to the one used on roads to punish driving offences.\\n\\nAny driver who accrues 12 points on their superlicence over a rolling 12-month period receives a one-race ban. Points are wiped when the year anniversary of the respective offence is reached. No driver has yet reached the 12-point limit.\\n\\nHaas driver Esteban Gutierrez leads the table after the Japanese GP with seven points, five of which were collected in the space of just three races either side of the summer break. The Mexican picked up three at Spa for blocking Pascal Wehrlein on the 200mph Kemmel Straight.\\n\\nSebastian Vettel runs into Nico Rosberg at the start of the Malaysia GP. Sebastian Vettel runs into Nico Rosberg at the start of the Malaysia GP.\\n\\nChampionship leader Nico Rosberg is next up with six after being found at fault for collisions with Lewis Hamilton (Austria), Max Verstappen (Germany) and Kimi Raikkonen (Malaysia).

In Bahrain he was punished for briefly reversing in the pit lane after qualifying, while in Russia he was warned about not rejoining the track in the correct manner during practice.\\n\\nThe world championship leader, who took a big grid penalty after the summer break for exceeding engine elements, is therefore one more reprimand of any kind away from a costly 10-place drop.\\n\\nToro Rosso's Carlos Sainz is the only other driver on two reprimands for the season.\",\n",
       " 'Dr John Bates\\' disclosures about the manipulation of data behind the so-called \\'Pausebuster\\' paper is the biggest scientific scandal since \\'Climategate\\' in 2009 when, as Britain\\'s Daily Mail reported, thousands of leaked emails revealed scientists were trying to block access to data, and using a \\'trick\\' to conceal embarrassing flaws in their claims about global warming.\\n\\nBritain\\'s Mail on Sunday today revealed astonishing evidence that the organisation that is the world\\'s leading source of climate data rushed to publish a landmark paper that exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris Agreement on climate change.\\n\\nA high-level whistleblower has told this newspaper that America\\'s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) breached its own rules on scientific integrity when it published the sensational but flawed report, aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015.\\n\\nThe report claimed that the \\'pause\\' or \\'slowdown\\' in global warming in the period since 1998 – revealed by UN scientists in 2013 – never existed, and that world temperatures had been rising faster than scientists expected. Launched by NOAA with a public relations fanfare, it was splashed across the world\\'s media, and cited repeatedly by politicians and policy makers.\\n\\nBut the whistleblower, Dr John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown The Mail on Sunday irrefutable evidence that the paper was based on misleading, \\'unverified\\' data.\\n\\nIt was never subjected to NOAA\\'s rigorous internal evaluation process – which Dr Bates devised.\\n\\nHis vehement objections to the publication of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a \\'blatant attempt to intensify the impact\\' of what became known as the Pausebuster paper.\\n\\nIn an exclusive interview, Dr Bates accused the lead author of the paper, Thomas Karl, who was until last year director of the NOAA section that produces climate data – the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) – of \\'insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximised warming and minimised documentation… in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming pause, rushed so that he could time publication to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy\\'.\\n\\nThe scandal has disturbing echoes of the \\'Climategate\\' affair which broke shortly before the UN climate summit in 2009, when the leak of thousands of emails between climate scientists suggested they had manipulated and hidden data. Some were British experts at the influential Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.\\n\\nHis disclosures are likely to stiffen President Trump\\'s determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor\\'s \\'green\\' policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal – so triggering an intense political row.\\n\\nAs The Mail continues, whatever takes its place, said Dr Bates, \"there needs to be a fundamental change to the way NOAA deals with data so that people can check and validate scientific results. I\\'m hoping that this will be a wake-up call to the climate science community – a signal that we have to put in place processes to make sure this kind of crap doesn\\'t happen again.\\n\\n\"I want to address the systemic problems. I don\\'t care whether modifications to the datasets make temperatures go up or down. But I want the observations to speak for themselves, and for that, there needs to be a new emphasis that ethical standards must be maintained.\" He said he decided to speak out after seeing reports in papers including the Washington Post and Forbes magazine claiming that scientists feared the Trump administration would fail to maintain and preserve NOAA\\'s climate records. Dr Bates said: \"How ironic it is that there is now this idea that Trump is going to trash climate data, when key decisions were earlier taken by someone whose responsibility it was to maintain its integrity – and failed.\"\\n\\nNOAA not only failed, but it effectively mounted a cover-up when challenged over its data.\\n\\nAfter the paper was published, the US House of Representatives Science Committee launched an inquiry into its Pausebuster claims. NOAA refused to comply with subpoenas demanding internal emails from the committee chairman, the Texas Republican Lamar Smith, and falsely claimed that no one had raised concerns about the paper internally. Last night Mr Smith thanked Dr Bates \"for courageously stepping forward to tell the truth about NOAA\\'s senior officials playing fast and loose with the data in order to meet a politically predetermined conclusion\". He added: \"The Karl study used flawed data, was rushed to publication in an effort to support the President\\'s climate change agenda, and ignored NOAA\\'s own standards for scientific study.\" Professor Curry, now the president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said last night: \\'Large adjustments to the raw data, and substantial changes in successive dataset versions, imply substantial uncertainties.\\' It was time, she said, that politicians and policymakers took these uncertainties on board.\\n\\nRead more here...',\n",

Scientists suspect these events will appear more frequently in the future as climate warming affects Antarctica.\\n\\nFountain\\'s research was conducted in tandem with another National Science Foundation-funded site, Palmer Station, on the West Antarctic Peninsula, a vastly different Antarctic landscape.\\n\\nThe extreme climate shift at Palmer during 2001 and 2002 caused freezing and melting at the edge of the peninsula, resulting in increased algal bloom and Antarctic krill, a devastating decline in the population of Adelie penguins, and an increase in the populations of gentoo and chinstrap penguins.\\n\\nExplore further: Climate is changing fast in West Antarctica',\n",

       " 'Anyone who\\'s read this blog knows my opinion of Mike Adams, the proprietor of the quack website known as NaturalNews.com. It is not favorable, to put it mildly. All you have to do to realize that is to type his name into the search box of this blog and see what comes up: Anger at his attacks on celebrities who have died of cancer; mockery of his pretending to be a scientist and attacking Jimmy Kimmel for \"hate speech\" about vaccines; alarm at his threats delivered with somewhat plausible deniability against scientists; further alarm at his \"natural biopreparedness\" and homeopathy for Ebola; and, of course amusement at his New World Order conspiracy mongering. In terms of blog fodder, Adams is the gift that keeps on giving. Unfortunately, in terms of his influence against science and medicine and for pseudoscience and quackery, his influence is not insubstantial, so much so that when the opportunity presents itself I feel obligated to discuss him.\\n\\n\\nThe opportunity has presented itself in the form of an excellent summation of the empire of pseudoscience and quackery that is Mike Adams by Sacha Feinman entitled Meet The Internet Entrepreneur Profiting Off The Anti-Vaxxer Movement. Of course, I have one quibble about this title. Adams profits off of way more than the antivaccine movement. Quackery, fear mongering about food, Scientology-like hatred of psychiatry to the point where after the Sandy Hook school massacre, he immediately blamed psychiatric medications for the rampage of Adam Lanza, the perpetrator of the massacre. But that\\'s just a quibble. The article itself tells the tale quite well. It also confirms something I\\'ve been writing for quite a while now, namely how Adams got his quacky start selling Y2K scams:\\n\\nTowards the turn of the millennium, the Y2K bug was much on the mind of the media, representing perhaps the first great conspiracy of the digital age. True believers held that the seemingly simple switchover from 12/31/99 to 1/1/00 would cause computers and electronic systems the world over to crash, triggering international crises of every conceivable sort. Adams saw the opportunity in the situation, and began to sell supposed \"information products\" that would insulate his paying audience from the oncoming chaos, which, of course, never came. In a since-deleted excerpt on Adams\\' site published by ZDNet, Adams boasted that in 1999, \"in an effort to fine-tune his web marketing techniques, Michael [Adams] launched a six-month experiment to determine what kind of revenues are possible when combining his proprietary techniques and technologies with a high-awareness topic. The result? With the help of only one employee, he created a subscriber base of over 50,000 people and sold over $400,000 worth of information products while offering an open-ended, 100% moneyback [sic] guarantee.\" This subscriber base was largely won over by Adams\\' then infamous \"39 Unanswered Questions about Y2K.\" In a foreshadowing of the sorts of the \"listicles\" that would drive traffic to both Natural News and the site\\'s advertisers (not to mention BuzzFeed), Adams demonstrated a remarkable ability to frame a controversial issue in a manner perfectly suited for digital consumption. The widely shared email consisted of a series of fear-mongering questions such as, \"Why is there not a single Fortune 1000 firm that has said, in its 10-Q SEC statement, that it is fully, unequivocally Y2K-compliant?\" Critics panned the listicle as, \"a national spamming campaign against the press and politicians to stir up enough anxiety to clear the shelves of Y2K supplies\" and, \"the best publicity stunt I\\'ve seen.\"\\n\\nSo from the beginning, Adams was talented. He saw the possibilities in web marketing to drive traffic to his sites and use that to monetize them very early on, and to monetize them selling scams. In this, we can see him honing his early techniques. Indeed, he took it far beyond just that, mastering the dark arts of using \"black hat\" search engine optimization, running link farms, and using those skills to drive traffic back to his site. It turns out that the skill set that made Adams so talented at crafting mass e-mail marketing campaigns that actually persuaded the marks to give up their money is the same skill set that he later honed to become an expert at SEO.\\n\\nBut how successful has he been? According to Feinman:\\n\\nAccording to the service comScore, Natural News hosted over 2 million unique visitors in the month of December 2014. The website\\'s Google PageRank is a respectable six, the same number enjoyed by other, more mainstream preachers of the \"natural\" space. The CEO of Whole Foods John Mackey\\'s blog also receives a six, as do the landing pages for Andrew Weil and Deepak Chopra. Adams claims that he has, \"',\n",

       " 'How do we accept the truth? What ingredients are necessary for a person to change their most treasured beliefs if these beliefs are actually erroneous? Here we will review the \"four essentials\" for accepting truth. All four of these qualities are indispensable. If even one is missing or lacking, it will be extremely difficult for a person to accept and embrace reality. Let us review each one in turn:\\n\\n1. Intelligence\\n\\nFirst, in order to accept the truth, a person must utilize their inherent intelligence. This includes the ability to use logic, reason, and intuition to understand a complex problem—often called critical thinking. Many people lose their critical thinking skills when they are subjectively biased toward their own paradigm or worldview. Critical thinking is important because it allows a person to think objectively, rather than subjectively, and is an essential step for actually learning the truth. The moment we cease to think critically, we cease to intelligently engage in disciplined thought that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence.\\n\\nA great hindrance to learning truth occurs when we already have our conclusions formed before even examining the evidence. This happens when people think, for instance, \"I know this is true, so I will refuse to look at any evidence to the contrary until I find something that might substantiate my already-determined beliefs.\" Thinking in this way does not allow a person to learn or progress in the direction of truth. In reality, our thinking should be the other way around. One should form conclusions after weighing all the evidence, rather than ignoring most of the evidence and searching until one can find some small piece of evidence to support an already drawn conclusion. Sherlock Holmes aptly described this situation when he said, \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts\" (Arthur Conan Doyle, A Scandal in Bohemia).\\n\\n2. Truth\\n\\nSecond, in order to accept truth, a person must have access to true information regarding the church\\'s actual history, origins, and doctrines. Many people are unaware of what actually happened when our church began and during the intervening years since then. They are exposed only to the church\\'s version of its history, which unfortunately is highly romanticized and inaccurate. As a result, they are \"only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it\" (D&C 123:12). Still other people are afraid to look at the actual true history because they have been taught all their lives that any negative information about the church is \"of the adversary\" or \"poison for the soul.\" Perhaps such people do not realize that \"the truth stands boldly and unafraid; it is not shaken by the testing; For truth, if it be truth, arises from each testing stronger, more secure. Those that would silence doubt are filled with fear\" (Robert Weston). Only error fears investigation. If you are being instructed not to investigate something, then there is probably something being hidden that you deserve to know.\\n\\nAlong with this second essential is included the incentive and personal drive to study the true information and validate its sources. Many people, upon discovering the truth regarding our church, find themselves absorbed in months and months of fascinating study. Because a whole new world of information has been opened to their view, they acquire an insatiable desire to learn the truth. This desire and thirst for truth is crucial for anyone who wishes to acquire wisdom and live a life of integrity. It is important that each person arrives at their own conclusion based upon their personal study and critical thinking.\\n\\nPerhaps you have heard the story of a young man who approached the great thinker, Aristotle, and asked him the profound question: \"How can I have wisdom?\" Aristotle smiled and replied, \"Follow me.\" The young man followed closely as they made their way into a pool of water. Aristotle suddenly turned and pushed the young man under the water. The student flailed with his arms, but to no avail. Aristotle was the stronger of the two, and he held the struggling lad\\'s head beneath the surface. At the last possible moment, Aristotle pulled him up, dragged him over to the edge, and sat him down. Coughing and gasping for air, the student could hardly believe what had just occurred. Unmoved by the young man\\'s confusion and surprise, Aristotle simply asked him, \"Young man, when I held you under the water, what did you want more than anything in the world?\" He sputtered between coughs, \"Air, sir . . . air!\" Aristotle then responded, \"When you want wisdom as badly as you wanted air, then you will find it.\"\\n\\nJohn Adams observed: \"Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\" In our information age, the facts and the evidence are readily available to us. We need only to have',\n",

       " 'Stacey Gayle used to love music. Listening to it and performing it was a big part of her life. She had stacks of CDs in her car, went to concerts of artists like Sean Paul, and would go to parties where hot songs would blare. She was also an active member of the choir at her church: Solid Rock Church of the Nazarene.\\n\\n\\nThen she started having seizures.\\n\\n\\nThe first one happened while she slept in her bedroom in Rosedale, Queens in New York City on the night of March 3, 2005. She had just turned 22. Her mother rushed her to the emergency room, where doctors stabilized her. Several brain scans and blood tests gave no clue as to why she seized.\\n\\n\\nSoon after, she had another, this time at a friend\\'s barbecue. She blacked out, fell down and started to shake like crazy as her brain cells went out of whack, firing electrical signals without pause.\\n\\n\\nAt first, the seizures seemed to occur randomly. In the spring of 2006, however, she noticed a pattern. At the time, Sean Paul\\'s \"Temperature\" was sitting at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, continually being played on urban radio stations. It was playing at nearly every barbecue and party she went to. That was a problem: \"Every time it would go on, I would pass out and go into a seizure,\" she recalls.\\n\\n\\nAll it seemed to take was a few seconds of the song to send Gayle to the floor. \"That\\'s the last thing you would think,\" she explains, \"but I did it at home one time and it happened again.\"\\n\\n\\nTo Gayle, it was clear that the music was causing her seizures. Afraid no one would believe her, she didn\\'t tell a soul except for a lone confidant. Her neurologist, Alan Ettinger at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center (LIJ) in New Hyde Park, N.Y., was in the dark as he put her through a gauntlet of prescriptions. She would eventually try out six antiseizure drugs. The medications offered little relief.\\n\\n\\n\"When you look at individuals who have seizures and whose seizures have not responded to a good trial of two antiseizure medications, the chances of becoming seizure-free from another medication, or another after that, is very slim,\" says Ettinger.\\n\\n\\nTo try to figure out how to treat Gayle, Ettinger and a colleague admitted her to an epilepsy monitoring unit in early 2007. The idea was to let her have a seizure. For four days, she wore a cap studded with electrodes so that doctors could observe her brain waves and videotape her.\\n\\n\\nThey took her off her medications. No seizure came.\\n\\n\\nThe doctors then tried keeping her awake. Nothing.\\n\\n\\nGayle was tired of waiting; she had plans to fly to Jamaica the next day. So she told them to hand over her iPod. She put \"Temperature\" on repeat and drifted off to sleep.\\n\\n\\nShe seized three times that night.\\n\\n\\n\"The doctors were flabbergasted; they were speechless,\" says Gayle. \"They couldn\\'t believe what I was saying was actually true.\"\\n\\n\\nThe next day, Stacey went to JFK Airport on her way to the Caribbean. But as she approached her gate, she overheard Sean Paul blaring from an airport bar.\\n\\n\\nShe never made it onto her flight.\\n\\n\\nSoon, the reaction spread. Throughout the next year other popular hip-hop and R&B songs like Rihanna\\'s repetitively infectious \"Umbrella\" and crooner Sean Kingston\\'s earnest \"Beautiful Girl\" sent Gayle to the floor. She was also responding to alternative music and the sound of the drums that accompanied her church choir\\'s performances. Suddenly it seemed like the only types of music that weren\\'t causing her to have a seizure were jazz and classical—both of which she didn\\'t particular like.\\n\\n\\nGayle was forced to drop out of school that fall because of her illness. Personalized ring tones drove her nuts. \"When people\\'s phones were going off in class, I was having a lot of seizures at school,\" she says. \"Life just turns upside down when you take music out of it: I remember sitting outside of stores in the mall and crying because I can\\'t even go shopping or sit in a restaurant and eat.\"\\n\\n\\nShe briefly took a job, working at a Bank of America in Manhattan. But, she couldn\\'t handle the noises on the subway, and she would seize frequently both on her commute and at the office.\\n\\n\\nWith medication having been an unequivocal failure, her doctors were wondering if they could do anything other than keep music away from her—an unlikely proposition.\\n\\n\\nMacdonald Critchley first described musicogenic epilepsy—the technical term for seizures caused by music—in a 1937 paper, according to celebrated neurologist Oliver Sacks\\'s latest book',\n",

Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson had stepped down amid public fury at revelations in the Panama Papers that his family had sheltered money offshore.\\n\\nThe Guardian revealed this month that while an MP, Benediktsson – whose name also appeared in the Panama Papers – had himself sold millions of króna of assets in a major Icelandic bank\\'s investment fund as the state was about to seize control of the country\\'s failing financial sector at the peak of the 2008 crisis.\\n\\nThe prime minister, a member of one of Iceland\\'s wealthiest families, has denied any wrongdoing, but newly leaked documents suggest his relationship with Glitnir bank was close enough to raise serious questions about a possible conflict of interest between his roles as an MP and one of its most valued clients.\\n\\nIceland PM sold bank assets hours before financial crash, leaks show Read more\\n\\nGlitnir Holdco, which administers the collapsed bank\\'s estate, has since sought an injunction preventing Stundin and Reykjavik Media, the Icelandic news outlets that worked on the investigation with the Guardian, from publishing more of the leaked data. Benediktsson has said he had nothing to do with the gagging order.\\n\\nDespite the scandals, polls show the prime minister\\'s conservative Independence party – a member of 19 of the 27 governments that have run modern Iceland – is now edging ahead in the race with its main rival, the Left-Green Movement, which earlier this month held a clear lead.\\n\\nHeaded by 41-year-old Katrín Jakobsdóttir, the Left-Greens have largely succeeded the more traditional Social Democrats as the leading party of the Icelandic left, campaigning against inequality and for greater investment in public services and higher taxes for the better-off.\\n\\nPolls show nearly half of Iceland\\'s voters would like the popular Jakobsdóttir, seen as representing a new breed of politician, to be prime minister – around twice the number who say they plan to vote for her party. A centre-left government would be only the second since Iceland won full independence from Denmark in 1944.\\n\\nAt least six other parties – including a new Centre Party launched by Gunnlaugsson – could win seats in the 63-member alþingi in a continuing fragmentation of Icelandic politics that reflect mounting voter dissatisfaction with the cronyism and corruption many see as endemic in their political and business classes.\\n\\n\\nIceland was plunged into a deep recession following the 2008 crash, during which its three major banks, including Glitnir, failed with liabilities of 11 times the country\\'s GDP. The stock market fell 97%, the value of the króna halved, and Iceland became the first western European country in 25 years to ask the International Monetary Fund for a bailout.\\n\\n\\nA perception now exists that Benediktsson, 47, \"is part of the elite that crashed the system\", said Egill Helgason, a political commentator at the public broadcaster, RUV. The prime minister and his circle suffer from a serious lack of trust in the wake of recent scandals, he said.\\n\\nWith growth surging at 7.2% last year, however, and unemployment down at just 2.5%, it seems likely that many Icelandic voters still see the Independence party, which has campaigned on a platform of tax cuts and more business investment, as the most likely to deliver economic stability.',\n",

       " 'Take the Seattle Public Library Survey About Their New Logo and \"Brand Statement\"\\n\\nNo matter what they change your name to, you\\'ll always be the Seattle Public Library to me. Max Herman / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOh, god, really, Seattle Public Library? You are so committeed up and you have so much extra dough sitting around* that you\\'ve hired a design agency \"to develop a rebrand\"? (Full press release at the end of this post.) Ugh, fine, okay, I\\'ll take your survey. I love the library, I\\'m happy to help.\\n\\nHere, everyone, take the survey.\\n\\nThe first question proposes changing the \"brand\" from Seattle Public Library to Seattle Public Libraries. Rather than asking what\\'s better, what appeals to you more, what sounds most like the library as you think of it, they ask you what the difference is. As if it\\'s a test to see if you know what words mean. The difference is that one is singular and one is plural.\\n\\nTheir survey:\\n\\nSorry to show you my answers. You should answer your own personal truth.\\n\\nAs for which \"brand\" identity of the two evokes \"communities\"? Curious question. \"Communities\" is plural, so the only one that evokes the plural word is the other plural word. Is that really what you wanted to ask? Is this a survey or is this a new-media, feel-good smokescreen for a decision someone wants to make without being on the hook for making a decision? Just change the name if you want to change the name! Clearly, someone wants to change the name, but they also and just as importantly want to be able to say, later, \"Well, Susan, everyone who answered the survey said \\'libraries\\' evokes \\'communities\\' more than \\'library\\' does, so we better change it, because democracy.\"\\n\\nAs for question 3: Far be it from me to just underline what a pointless exercise this is with an example, but something that would concretely help us move forward as a community even more than whatever letters you want to hang on the wall is, say, having a microfilm/microfiche situation that doesn\\'t require running back and forth between the microfilm machine and the printer and having to punch in very long sequences of numbers and passwords each time one wants to print a single page. But that\\'s just me. (Sincerely, thanks for all the help couple weeks back, library staff—you are awesome. It\\'s the administrative apparatus around you, epitomized by this goofy rebrand, that fills my head with question marks.)\\n\\nOkay, moving on, it\\'s time to see the new \"brand statement\"! Here we go. Screengrab from my phone while I was sitting at Madison Pub last night trying to help the library.\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, the brand new, surely-worked-over-to-death-by-a-whole-bunch-of-people brand statement.\\n\\nI didn\\'t have room in the field to type the following:\\n\\n1. Where. Is. Your. Serial. Comma. What. Is. Wrong. With. You. \"Provides\" and \"experiences\" are both verbs, and when you don\\'t have a serial comma after \"experiences\" to make things clear, you can\\'t help but read \"experiences\" as a verb the first time through (you read it the same way you read \"provides\") and be confused when you get to \"and learning for all.\" How do you experience \"and learning\"? God, I wish I could experience some \"and learning\" right now. Oh you mean \"experiences\" as a noun! After you read it five or six times, it becomes clear what the SEATTLE PUBLIC LIBRARY is trying to say using words.\\n\\n2. Kind of. I mean, how much difference is there between \"learning\" and \"knowledge\"? How much overlap on the Venn diagram do \"learning\" and \"knowledge\" have? If you\\'re going to put three nouns in a row (and confusingly make one of them seem like a verb) it might be clearer to choose three nouns that are distinct from each other, instead of two that are slightly redundant (one of which doesn\\'t even read as a noun the first time through).\\n\\n3. \"We preserve and create opportunities for the people of Seattle who make it such a dynamic and desirable place to live.\" Huh. Sounds nice. But then it makes you think. What about the people who do not make Seattle both \"dynamic and desirable\"? What about painfully shy people who rarely leave the house? Are they good, too? Or is the library only for people doing cartwheels and condo conversions?\\n\\n4. \"When we\\'re empowered as individuals, we\\'re STRONGER TOGETHER.\" Is that possibly from some other piece of text',\n",
       " \"I try to lay my biases out on the table when it comes to reviewing games here so you can get a feel for when I may be judging a game too harshly or if I'm making myself deliberately oblivious to some of the more glaring faults. I believe this works well as you know things like survival horror and open world games are likely to get rated down whilst things like RTS, RPGs and FPSs are usually going to be rated slightly higher (although there are notable exceptions). Still though I try my best to rate a game based on its merits in relation to other titles within the same genre and thus Sleeping Dogs, the latest instalment in the True Crime series from Luxoflux and United Front Games, will be judged against other recent titles like Prototype 2.\\n\\nSleeping Dogs takes place in present day Hong Kong putting you in control of an undercover agent named Wei Shen. Your job is to infiltrate the infamous Sun On Yee triad in hopes to bring them down from the inside starting out by using one of your former connections to gain a first meeting with one of their Red Poles, Winston Chu. From there the game takes the usual route of open world escalation, starting you off in the doldrums beating up vendors for protection money as you work your way up the gang hierarchy. At the same time the police want to use your connections to help further their cause in other areas leading you to bust up drug rings, smuggling operations and prostitution syndicates.\\n\\nVisually Sleeping Dogs is quite vibrant drawing inspiration from the real Hong Kong's neon saturated environment. From what I can recall the graphics are pretty much on par with other open world titles like Grand Theft Auto IV meaning they're pretty good but they make trade offs in order to keep the game running smoothly as you rush through busy streets crowded with people and cars. I had to actually turn the graphics down slightly from their ultra maximum settings due to the frame rate dropping so much (although that might be an issue rather than a compliment as I'll expand on later).\\n\\nLike all open world games Sleeping Dogs features a multitude of different core game mechanics, mini-games and open world events to while away your time with. The main core of the game is a cross between an Arkham Asylum/City style beat-em-up and Grand Theft Auto's weapon focused game play. Sleeping Dogs also throws free running in there for good measure, allowing you to climb all over different parts of Hong Kong in the search for collectibles, upgrades and cold hard cash. I guess the feeling I'm trying to convey here is that there is certainly a lot to do in Sleeping Dogs, possible even more than I've come across in other recent open world titles.\\n\\nThe main plot of the story is progressed via 2 different styles of missions: ones with the triads and the other with the police. These take the usual typical open world style of giving you a way point on your map that you can travel to at your leisure and there's no hard and fast requirement to do the triad and police missions in sync with each other. Indeed I chose to most of the triad missions first as I found them to be more fun (and more rewarding) which did leave me in the rather awkward position of having to travel the full length of the map constantly as I had progressed out of the area in which the police missions take place. I kind of feel like this could have been remedied by the developers by having multiple police locations for the missions which would've saved me quite a bit of time.\\n\\nThe experience system also works along the separate cop/triad lines with each of them giving you access to an unique set of upgrades. The triads are focused mostly on melee upgrades, giving you additional moves as well as improving your effectiveness in melee combat. The cop upgrades focus more on vehicles and weapons, giving you access to things like a slim jim to jack cars without setting off the alarms. In addition to the two main upgrade paths there's also several ancillary upgrade paths that unlock more cars, additional melee moves as well as upgrades to your total health.\\n\\nThe main experience system works on the idea of stars, with 3 being the highest you can get. They work in different directions however with the police experience starting off at maximum and then you losing points for doing things wrong (like running people over) whilst the triad experience increases, ostensibly for being as brutal as you possibly can be. These two things are in direct competition with each other and it's often a choice between maximising one or the other. What got me though is that the bars need to be completely filled in order for them to be considered achieved meaning that for the police experience you can't do 1 thing wrong and for the triads you really need to go all out at all times in order to get it. The triads one I can understand, its something you work towards, but the cops one feels a bit anal as you can lose points by simply touching another car, depriving you of an entire block of experience even if\",\n",

I have quibbles, certainly... but all in all I thought it was magnificent, far and away the best fantasy film ever made. As to whether it will mean a general revival of fantasy in Hollywood... well, we can hope. If they are all done as well as FELLOWSHIP, that would be exciting indeed, but I fear they won\\'t be. On a personal level, the studios aren\\'t lining up to buy A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE yet, but it does look as though I am about to close a film deal on \"The Skin Trade,\" and there is some interest in WILD CARDS as well.

       " 'Columbus, Ohio ( ) —\\n\\nResearchers have found that the melanopsin pigment in the eye is potentially more sensitive to light than its more famous counterpart, rhodopsin, the pigment that allows for night vision.\\n\\nFor more than two years, the staff of the Laboratory for Computational Photochemistry and Photobiology (LCPP) at Ohio\\'s Bowling Green State University (BGSU), have been investigating melanopsin, a retina pigment capable of sensing light changes in the environment, informing the nervous system and synchronizing it with the day/night rhythm. Most of the study\\'s complex computations were carried out on powerful supercomputer clusters at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC).\\n\\nSuperposition of computer models of human melanopsin (violet) and squid rhodopsin (green). Similar to visual pigments, melanopsin provides the interface between the physical world, responsible for light detection, and the physiological world of brain signaling. Melanopsin mediates a process termed \\'photoentrainment,\\' which takes in light to set the clock of \"circadian rhythms.\" These rhythms (often termed the body clock) represent the biological implementation of the 24-hour day/night and optimize the corresponding physiology\\n\\nThe research recently appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, in an article edited by Arieh Warshel, Ph.D., of the University of Southern California. Warshel and two other chemists received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing multiscale models for complex chemical systems, the same techniques that were used in conducting the BGSU study, \"Comparison of the isomerization mechanisms of human melanopsin and invertebrate and vertebrate rhodopsins.\"\\n\\n\"The retina of vertebrate eyes, including those of humans, is the most powerful light detector that we know,\" explains Massimo Olivucci, Ph.D., a research professor of Chemistry and director of LCPP in the Center for Photochemical Sciences at BGSU. \"In the human eye, light coming through the lens is projected onto the retina where it forms an image on a mosaic of photoreceptor cells that transmits information from the surrounding environment to the brain\\'s visual cortex. In extremely poor illumination conditions, such as those of a star-studded night or ocean depths, the retina is able to perceiv e intensities corresponding to only a few photons, which are indivisible units of light. Such extreme sensitivity is due to specialized photoreceptor cells containing a light sensitive pigment called rhodopsin.\"\\n\\nFor a long time, it was assumed that the human retina contained only photoreceptor cells specialized in dim-light and daylight vision, according to Olivucci. However, recent studies revealed the existence of a small number of intrinsically photosensitive nervous cells that regulate non-visual light responses. These cells contain a rhodopsin-like protein named melanopsin, which plays a role in the regulation of unconscious visual reflexes and in the synchronization of the body\\'s responses to the dawn/dusk cycle, known as circadian rhythms or the \"body clock,\" through a process known as photoentrainment.\\n\\nThe fact that the melanopsin density in the vertebrate retina is 10,000 times lower than that of rhodopsin density, and that, with respect to the visual photoreceptors, the melanopsin-containing cells capture a million-fold fewer photons, suggests that melanopsin may be more sensitive than rhodopsin. The comprehension of the mechanism that makes this extreme light sensitivity possible appears to be a prerequisite to the development of new technologies.\\n\\nBoth rhodopsin and melanopsin are proteins containing a derivative of vitamin A, which serves as an \"antenna\" for photon detection. When a photon is detected, the proteins are set in an activated state, through a photochemical transformation, which ultimately results in a signal being sent to the brain. Thus, at the molecular level, visual sensitivity is the result of a trade-off between two factors: light activation and thermal noise. It is currently thought that light-activation efficiency (i.e., the number of activation events relative to the total number of detected photons) may be related to its underlying speed of chemical transformation. On the other hand, the thermal noise depends on the number of activation events triggered by ambient body heat in the absence of photon detection.\\n\\n\"Understanding the mechanism that determines this seemingly amazing light sensitivity of melanopsin may open up new pathways in studying the evolution of light receptors in vertebrate and, in turn, the molecular basis of diseases, such as \"seasonal affecting disorders,\" Olivucci said. \"Moreover, it provides a model for developing sub-nanoscale sensors approaching the sensitivity of a single-photon.\"\\n\\nFor this reason, the LCPP group – working together with Francesca Fanelli, Ph.D., of Italy\\'s Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia',\n",

       " 'By Thanasis Delistathis* / @tdelistathis\\n\\nFriends often ask me to opine on the Greek debt crisis. They are looking for some insight into what is going on and why the country is at the brink of bankruptcy. I suppose they think my heritage makes me more qualified to offer such insight.\\n\\nThe Greek crisis in many ways is a simple story; the predictable outcome of policies and cultural idiosyncrasies. So here is an attempt to tell the story with a few charts:\\n\\n1. Define it. Why is Greece in trouble?\\n\\n\\n2. Did Greece get in trouble because Greeks don\\'t work hard (\"you know, with those long siestas over lunch\"), kind of like the Germans? No.\\n\\n3. So, if the Greeks work so hard, how come they don\\'t produce enough to cover their obligations?\\n\\n4. Why is productivity so low? Over the years, politicians have grown the size of government. They also love to regulate. Over the last 30 years they have passed 4,000 new laws and issued about 110,000 ministerial directives. You need a lot of people to enforce these laws. Public servants in Greece get lifetime tenure!! Politicians loved growing the government to curry favor with voters.\\n\\n5. At the same time, Greeks love to strike to fight for more benefits. Politicians were happy to offer more.\\n\\n6. Speaking of state favoritism, how about corruption in general? Greece ranks at the bottom within the EU.\\n\\n7. On top of that, on average Greeks retire earlier…\\n\\n8. And thus have a higher dependency support ratio (ratio of number of people aged over 65 plus kids up to 15 per 100 persons of working age between 15–65). In reality, this significantly underestimates the true dependency ratio, since the country suffers from high rates of youth unemployment and many people retire before the age of 65. In other words, too many people depend for their livelihood on the too few who work.\\n\\n9. At the same time, the government is not bringing in enough revenues. How do we know this? Greece has the largest – as percentage of the economy – shadow or underground economy.\\n\\n10. How can they escape taxes? Most of the people work for tiny businesses who conduct private cash transactions that can more easily be hidden.\\n\\n11. And by the way, the number of those businesses in going down…\\n\\n12. While the VAT taxes remain high relative to others in Europe…\\n\\n13. So, to sum it up Greece doesn\\'t seem to be a great place to do business.\\n\\n14. How bad? One group ranks the country 130th in the world…\\n\\n15. OK, so catch me up. What has happened to date?\\n\\n16. Has Greece actually accomplished anything during this process? Greece actually grew during the first 3 quarters of 2014.\\n\\n17. Say, what happened in Q4 of 2014? Looking at Chart 15 you might appreciate why Greeks were fed up with ongoing non-stop austerity measures. So they decided to elect a radical left coalition party that promised to undo the former policies. However, it seems consumers don\\'t have much confidence that the new leftist government will be able to reach an agreement with its eurozone partners.\\n\\n18. As fears also grew among investors, the cost of borrowing from the markets spiked…\\n\\n19 a. What does Greece need to do? Here is a list of policy recommendations from OECD for sustainable recovery, similar to the spirit of the reforms proposed by Greece\\'s EU partners.\\n\\n19 b. To date, the Syriza government has not shown any signs of agreement with the eurozone partners, choosing instead to comply with campaign promises of undoing many reforms by the prior government. Some in the left coalition government are openly advocating a default, exit from the Euro and return to the drachma. In fact, there are some economists who say this would be best for Greece as it would enable it to become competitive in global markets. While good in theory in an open well-functioning economy, the first time Greece elected a socialist government that followed similar policies, the drachma had quite a ride, downwards…\\n\\n20. In this era of uncertainty, businesses and investors have postponed investments and reversed economic growth, prompting the European Commission to slash growth estimates.\\n\\nAt this point, the future is indeed uncertain. Will the Syriza government agree to EU/IMF conditions for further loans and implement the program or choose to gamble with an exit from the Euro? We are days or weeks away from finding out.\\n\\n*Thanasis Delistathis is the founder and managing partner of New Atlantic Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm based in the Washington DC Metropolitan Region and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

       " \"The playmaker is set to be the subject of a bid from his former club in January, while Martin Demichelis will discuss terms over a new Manchester City contract\\n\\nBy Paul Clennam Valencia are lining up a €38 million January move for Juan Mata - but must wait for Peter Lim to complete his takeover of the Spanish side before pursuing a deal for the Manchester United playmaker.Lim, a Singapore-based businessman, has played a part in summer loan deals for Alvaro Negredo and Benfica pair Rodrigo and Andre Gomes, but is yet to reach an agreement with Bankia over the acquisition of the club.Valencia have the option to sign Manchester City striker Negredo for €32 million and should Lim's purchase of the club go through, they will also turn their attention to re-signing Mata.The former Chelsea star left Valencia for Stamford Bridge in 2011 but fell out of favour under Jose Mourinho and made a €47m January move to Old Trafford in 2014.The summer arrival of Louis van Gaal, followed by the signings of Radamel Falcao, Angel Di Maria and Ander Herrera, have seen Mata's place in the starting XI come under threat.And while it is unclear whether Mata would consider a return to Spain, United are understood to be willing to entertain offers of around €38m for the 26-year-old.Valencia are weighing up the possibility of signing Mata on an initial loan deal in January with a view to a permanent move in the summer.But any potential deal to sign Mata would be impossible if Lim's takeover of the club falls through.Lim has also recently acquired a 50 per cent stake in Salford City, the Evo-Stik Division One North outfit part-owned by former United players Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary and Phil Neville and Nicky Butt.Teenage forward Jose Angel Pozo's emergence as a Manchester City star in the making has cost the club a six-figure fee.Pozo joined the Premier League champions in 2012 from Real Madrid's youth setup, much to the chagrin of the Spanish giants.The 18-year-old, who has been likened to Barcelona star Lionel Messi, has since caught the eye in City's Elite Development Squad under the guidance of Patrick Vieira.Manuel Pellegrini handed Pozo his debut off the bench in the Capital One Cup victory over Sheffield Wednesday in midweek, with the teenager scoring late on in the 7-0 rout.Following his first appearance and goal for the club, City must now pay Madrid a six-figure fee as part of the deal which took Pozo to the Etihad.Martin Demichelis will discuss a 12-month contract extension with Manchester City in the coming weeks.Demichelis played under Manuel Pellegrini at Malaga and joined the Chilean at the Etihad in 2013 after a short stay with Atletico Madrid which lasted less than two months.The 33-year-old endured a difficult start to life in the Premier League and did not make his debut until October due to injury, but made a significant contribution as the club reclaimed the title last season.The centre-back's form saw him take part in the 2014 World Cup, playing in the final as Argentina narrowly lost to Germany.Despite the big-money summer arrival of Eliaquim Mangala, Demichelis is now set to extend his stay in the Premier League.\",\n",
       " 'AFL Players Association chief Paul Marsh admitted the players\\' union had already planned end-of-season talks with head office, although stressed what most clubs had confirmed – that the players have not questioned their earnings. Having attempted to set a minimum player wage of $5000 for the eight-week pre-season followed by the eight-week season, the AFL late last year negotiated a new set minimum with the AFLPA of $8500, to be increased to $9700 in 2018. If the above suggests the league did not see this success coming so quickly, it is also worth recalling that the AFL tried to schedule its first women\\'s game at Collingwood\\'s training ground – the old Olympic Park – and finished up apologising to thousands of fans unable to squeeze into Carlton\\'s Ikon Park, where almost 25,000 attended. Although the women\\'s contracts are proportionately paltry when measured against TV ratings, the clubs fielding the eight women\\'s teams continue to marvel at how enthusiastic their players have been to promote their sport compared with their male counterparts. In short, club officials are not used to footballers showing their appreciation. Several Brisbane Lions AFLW players cried when they were handed new football boots along with a set of runners and like those overstretched AFL staffers working long hours to put on the games, Marsh said players understood they were all working overtime together to achieve a common purpose.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve agreed to a standard playing contract for two years in good faith,\" said Marsh, \"and they [the AFL] could hold us to that, but we\\'ve already flagged we want to have a conversation with them and they\\'ve agreed. \"What we\\'re seeing is eight teams and eight sets of players who all want to do more. They are contracted to work for nine hours a week in terms of training and other appearances and they\\'re all doing more and they have no complaints about that. From our perspective there\\'s scope to have conversations with the AFL where we look at that for next year.\" The AFL refused to speculate on a new women\\'s media deal, saying it was too soon to measure the TV success just two rounds in, but would not rule out rewriting the agreement. How could it not on the figures to date? The Western Bulldogs\\' victory over Fremantle two weeks ago was the top-rating program in Melbourne that week, defeating My Kitchen Rules in a result that astonished the Seven Network. On market value, broadcasters and the AFL agree a prime-time women\\'s game is worth the same as Seven\\'s Saturday night winter AFL game. This is because Saturday night telecasts of AFLW have, in their infancy, rated as well as their male AFL equivalents, and on many comparisons better. On pay TV, Fox reports that the competition has quadrupled its male A-League numbers. In ratings terms, the women Australian rules footballers\\' wages look embarrassing when compared with the soccer men.\\n\\nOn every measure that counts, the AFL should be laughing all the way to the bank. As should its new breed of players. Except that they\\'re not, because the competition gave away the broadcast rights for free to Channel Seven and Foxtel on a two-year goodwill agreement. At one point the two parties even haggled over the production costs although in the end the networks picked up the tab, outsourcing the production of all games to Eddie McGuire\\'s McGuire Media. An agreement which only weeks ago appeared as if its broadcasters were doing the AFL a favour now presents as a bargain of the highest order. The decision to allow spectators to attend free has introduced new supporters to football, according to head office, and is likely to continue next season. New corporate partners such as Chemist Warehouse and Cotton On – supporting the women until at least the end of 2019 with a further three-year option – would not have come aboard the AFL without the women. The competition was disappointed Sydney failed to bid for a licence but the consequence is that GWS has signed more AFLW members (2000 at $60 each) and introduced new major sponsors to the club in Harvey Norman and Sydney Airport. Never have the Giants, still battling for recognition, received so much pre-season publicity. The short-term decisions facing the competition include where and when to hold the AFLW version of the Brownlow and whether to schedule a Melbourne grand final at the MCG or Ikon Park. But those appear insignificant compared with the looming review into how to handle the next phase of the AFLW - a competition launched in haste by impatient CEO Gillon McLachlan, but one that will surely prove his greatest legacy.',\n",
       " 'In a recent survey of 926 public high school biology teachers across the nation, only 28 percent of teachers taught evolution as a well-supported fundamental idea of science. Meanwhile, 13 percent openly supported \"intelligent design\" in the classroom, and 60 percent fell somewhere in-between. This majority presented evolution cautiouslyby including non-scientific viewpoints, by limiting discussion to genetics, or by saying that students only needed to learn the material to pass exams.\\n\\nWhat do you think about this?\\n\\n\\nBill Nye, Executive Director of the Planetary Society: It\\'s horrible. Science is the key to our future, and if you don\\'t believe in science, then you\\'re holding everybody back. And it\\'s fine if you as an adult want to run around pretending or claiming that you don\\'t believe in evolution, but if we educate a generation of people who don\\'t believe in science, that\\'s a recipe for disaster. We talk about the Internet. That comes from science. Weather forecasting. That comes from science. The main idea in all of biology is evolution. To not teach it to our young people is wrong.\\n\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\nWhy is there resistance to teaching evolution in schools?\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s reluctance to change. It\\'s wanting the world to be different than it is. And if you don\\'t want the world to be different you are an unusual human being. We all want the world to be different. But to deny evolution is in no one\\'s best interest.\\n\\nDo you think there\\'s anything that can be done about it?\\n\\n\\nWell the longest journey starts with just a single step. Science education: We should support it. Especially elementary school science. Nearly every rocket scientist got interested in it before they were 10. Everybody who\\'s a physician, who makes vaccines, who wants to find the cure for cancer. Everybody who wants to do any medical good for humankind got the passion for that before he or she was 10. So we want to excite a new generation of kidsevery generationabout the passion, beauty and joythe PB&Jof science. These anti-evolution people are frustrating in two ways. The first way is, almost certainly they know better. Those people really do believe in flu shots. They really do understand that when you find fossil bones of ancient dinosaurs, you are looking at deep time, not just 5000 years. And secondly, and much more importantly, having raised a generation of kids who don\\'t understand science is bad for everyone. And with the United States having a leadership role in science and technology, having a generation of kids not believing in science is bad for the world.\\n\\nIs there a funding issue? Is that why the teachers aren\\'t teaching it correctly?\\n\\n\\nOh the teachers get pulled every which way. People get on school boards just with this agenda of not teaching evolution. The school board comes running in and beats them over the head. But denying the facts does not make them not true. And in science we\\'re always looking for the truth, it\\'s what we do. Does this work? Does this solve the problem? Can you do the same experiment and get the same results?\\n\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\nShould teachers be mandated to teach evolution as fact?\\n\\n\\nWhat other fundamental theory in all of biology is there? Intelligent design, as the judge in Dover, Penn., said, is \"breathtaking inanity.\" It was so stupid it took his breath away. I agree with him. It\\'s great to teach in history class, though. People believed the earth was the center of the universe. People believed the earth was flat. It was reasonable at the time, but we don\\'t learn about those ideas in science class.\\n\\nSo do you think those biology teachers are simply teaching their own beliefs, or are they under outside pressure?\\n\\n\\nThey\\'re doing their job but they\\'re under tremendous pressure. The 60 percent who are cautiousthose are the people who are really up against it. They want to keep their job, and they love teaching science, and their children are really excited about it, and yet they\\'ve got some people insisting they can\\'t teach the most fundamental idea in all of biology. There\\'s the phrase \"just a theory.\" Which shows you that I have failed. I\\'m a failure. When we have a theory in science, it\\'s the greatest thing you can have. Relativity is a theory, and people test it every which way. They test it and test it and test it. Gravity is a theory. People have landed spacecraft on the moon within a few feet of accuracy because we understand gravity so well. People make flu vaccinations that stop people from getting sick. Farmers raise crops with science; they hybridize them and make them better with every generation. That\\'s all evolution. Evolution is a theory, and it\\'s a theory that you can test. We\\'ve tested evolution in many ways. You can\\'t present good evidence that says evolution is not a fact.',\n",
       " 'Researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory this week showed how an electronic voting machine model that\\'s expected to be widely used to tally votes in the 2012 elections can be easily hacked using inexpensive, widely-available electronic components.\\n\\nRoger Johnston, head of the Vulnerability Assessment Team at the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s science and engineering reseaech lab, said the hack, which requires about $25 and very little technical expertise, would let cybercriminals \"flip\" votes gathered on Diebold Accuvote TS machines and change election results without raising any suspicion.\\n\\nJohnston and his team have long warned about vulnerabilities in e-voting machines. And two years ago, the team demonstrated how a Sequoia touch screen e-voting machine could be similarly manipulated using cheap components.\\n\\nThe latest research was first reported by the Salon news site.\\n\\nIn the latest experiment, the Argonne researchers showed how a Diebold Accuvote TS touch screen voting machine can be compromised by inserting a man-in-the middle electronic component to intercept the vote cast by a voter and change it before it is recorded by the system.\\n\\nThe component which is less than half the size of a credit card, was assembled using a $1.29 microprocessor and a homemade circuit board that cost less than $10 to assemble.\\n\\nThe handmade component, which Johnston calls \"alien electronics,\" can be simply plugged into a ribbon cable inside the system. There is no need to solder it on to the system, he noted.\\n\\nOnce installed the \"alien electronics\" can be controlled remotely from a distance of up to a half mile using an ordinary store-brought $15 remote control.\\n\\nJohnston said the machine is \"incredibly easy to tamper with\" because all the crucial electronic components are accessible and can be easily modified. The Accuvote TS\\' enclosure isn\\'t tamper resistant so hjackers can work on the machine without leaving visible signs, he added.\\n\\n\"All we had to do was find out what the machine was doing in terms of communication,\" Johnston said. \"We just had to understand the various components and how the data was being sent. We needed to understand what signal had to be sent to fool the machine into thinking the voter had touched the screen at a particular location.\"\\n\\nThe experiment shows that e-voting systems are susceptible to more than just cyberattacks, which get the most attention but are harder to pull off as the perpetrators must have some knowledge of the machine\\'s software, hardware and firmware.\\n\\nThe so-called man-in-the-middle attacks don\\'t require knowledge of the voting machine\\'s proprietary software or hardware, Johnston said. \"All you need to do is understand the communication between the different parts of the system. Then you just sit there and listen and do whatever mischief you want to.\".\\n\\nThe Diebold intrusion was simpler than the Sequoia hack, which required his team to program the man-in the middle component to get the machine to alert users that their votes had been cast as well as changing the selection, he said.\\n\\n\"[The latest hack] was ridiculously easy. We just had to control the information coming in from the voter. If you send the computer the wrong candidate it simply assumes the data that is being sent is what the voter meant,\" Johnston said.\\n\\nAnd \"we could easily tamper with the printer output where the paper record would match what was stored electronically,\" he added.\\n\\nJohnston described the microprocessor and the other electronic parts used in the experiment as the sort that can be easily purchased at hobby stores or online. The chip could be programmed by people with only rudimentary skills, he noted.\\n\\n\"We wanted people not to get so hung up on cyber vulnerabilities,\" and consider other threats as well, he said.\\n\\nVoting systems are often left unguarded when they are not in use or while in transit and can easily be tampered without anyone knowing about it, he added.\\n\\nThe Diebold Accuvote TS is a direct recording electronic voting (DRE) machine, a type that has long drawn flak because it offers no verifiable paper record. Some experts also consider them unreliable, too hard to audit and prone to all sorts of tampering.\\n\\nSupporters of DRE systems insist that such concerns are overblown.\\n\\nAccording to statistics maintained by election watchdog Verified Voting, several states, including Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey and South Carolina currently use DREs without auditable paper trails.\\n\\nSeveral other states, including Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Tennessee and Virginia, use a combination of paperless DREs as well as paper ballots -- 32 states and the District of Columbia have laws that require DREs to be used only with verifiable paper records.\\n\\nPamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, said that the successful hack by Johnston\\'s team is not surprising.\\n\\n\"On',\n",

Normally, he wouldn\\'t be willing to let others use him in such a manner, yet he also understood the terrifying level the Metals professor and Fanu had reached! Yet, in the previous world, the one that caused the death of the Metals professor and Fanu and survived, was this man called Seaman – the Seaman who had an innate defensive ability!\\n\\nThis cruel reality further established Mogensha\\'s belief – This person must be made a friend, and not the enemy!\\n\\nAfter putting to rest his thoughts, Mogensha coughed loudly and attracted the attention of everyone else. He raised his voice.\\n\\n\"I am the golden AK user, Mogensha. Everyone probably have heard of my name before right? Is there anyone able to attack the two beasts outside?\"\\n\\nAfter he issued the statement, at least 5-6 others displayed an astonished expression, beginning whispering in each others ears. Seated in front of him, a male wearing a leather jacket frowned.\\n\\n\"I can, but firstly It isn\\'t enough to kill them, and I feel there isn\\'t a need to. Let the other transport ship distract them, wouldn\\'t it be better? This will secure our safe landing.\"\\n\\nMogensha laughed coldly, and ignored him. Opposite, a female very resolutely offered.\\n\\n\"I reckon I can communicate with the pilot first. If there is a need to retaliate, then we would definitely do so. But first I need to know the reason.\"\\n\\nObviously this woman\\'s prime ability should be her charm, but naturally she didn\\'t receive a resolute answer – because Mogensha himself did not understand what Sheyan was coming at. But Mogensha understood one thing, and that was Sheyan wished to attack the pursuing twin beasts a the back. If he couldn\\'t even accomplish the first request of Seaman, then his personal worth would no doubt decrease.\\n\\nMogensha acted decisively, drawing out his golden AK and aimed towards the 3 safety straps before releasing fire. He then reach out for the metal safety belt and exerted force lightly. A piercing metal cranking sound resounded, as he pulled off the metal safety straps that were binding him; finally standing up.\\n\\n\"What are you trying to do!\" Several stunned voices probed out. Disregarding them, Mogensha directly strode towards the little shuttle at the pilot cabin; releasing a robotic yet frustrated tone.\\n\\n\"Hoi! Mate in front. The two alien freaks have already annihilated at least 20 of our bros, and they look like they\\'re about to succeed again. Are we just gonna stay here stupidly?\"\\n\\nThe pilot snarled back.\\n\\n\"Do you think I don\\'t want to wreck their ass? F***, I swear on my son\\'s baseball cap. If this was a Valkyrie (anti-fighter spacecraft), then I would serve these two spore wyverns a taste of 8 rounds of H.A.L.O (High Altitude Long Operating) cluster rockets! But this is a bloody transport shuttle, although it is a specially enforced transport shuttle! Rather, you better F***king scram to your seat and buckle up!\"\\n\\nMogensha shrugged his shoulders dejectedly.\\n\\n\"Alright, looks like the only thing we can do is pray for them.\"\\n\\nThe pilot cleared his throat and suddenly issued.\\n\\n\"Wait wait, I remember while reinforcing this shuttle, that old Nick seemed to have installed a machine cannon. But the shuttle took off before there was time to link it to the firing system. But if you have confidence in yourself, then I can open the firing compartment. Yo still have to operate it manually. Truthfully, I don\\'t suggest you doing that.\"\\n\\nMogensha exposed a crafty smile.\\n\\n\"Just wait and watch the show.\"\\n\\nThe pilot extended a thumbs up without turning to him. Pressing somewhere, a long drawn out \\'Chi\\' sound emitted from the ceiling rampart. Another pilot chair rotated as it descended. Mogensha arrogantly took his seat, and ascended with the chair. The male in the leather jacket looked on disapprovingly, yet he didn\\'t dare to voice out. Mogensha\\'s golden AK was a rather impressive deterrent.\\n\\nIn a flash, illuminated tracer rounds were fired out from the hood of the transportation shuttle; directly piercing the body of a predatory spore wyvern. The unprepared spore wyvern immediately lost balance and starting rolling in mid space, screeching out in agony. Huge greenish sticky fluid gushed out from its',\n",

A hardcover version is expected to come out Monday.\\n\\nThe 104-page e-book, which is largely based on the contents of Powell's five personal journals detailing her sexual escapades, alleges that Louisville's former director of basketball operations Andre McGee hired her and other dancers for 22 shows performed from 2010 to 2014, mostly at the Billy Minardi Hall dormitory.\\n\\nShe said McGee, 28, paid her $10,000 for her services.\\n\\nAccording to Powell, 43, the parties thrown for Louisville recruits, their fathers and existing players involved sex with the strippers.\\n\\nIn one of the most shocking revelations in the book, an unapologetic Powell writes that she provided her own three daughters, who were 15, 17 and 19 years old at the time, as escorts for sex with the players.\\n\\n'People may think that I expose my kids,' an excerpt from Powell's diary printed in the book reads. 'But, s***, they enjoy themlselves, they meet new people Believe me, they have their own lives, but they enjoy the perks of shows.\\n\\n'For those who have a problem wit' this, kiss my a**.'\\n\\nSpecial recruitment: The 104-page e-book, which is largely based on the contents of Powell's alleges that Louisville's former director of basketball operations Andre McGee (pictured) hired her and other dancers for 22 shows performed from 2010 to 2014\\n\\nWitness speaks: Former Cardinals recruit JaQuan Lyle, now an Ohio State freshman, confirmed the 'gist of allegations' laid out in Powell's book during a meeting with NCAA\\n\\nFour investigations have been launched, two this week, to review Powell's explosive allegations.\\n\\nIn Chapter 1 of Breaking The Cardinal Rules, Powell and Cady write that in 2010, Powell, a high school dropout in her late 30s, was a divorced mother of three daughters struggling to make ends meet.\\n\\nAround the same time, she came to the realization that she could make easy money selling her body for sex.\\n\\nBombshell tome: The expose, Breaking The Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen, co-written by Powell and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dick Cady, was initially released as a Kindle book Friday. A hardcover version will be published Monday\\n\\n'No overhead, no taxes, no complaints, no regrets. Sugar for sugar,' she writes in the book.\\n\\nBefore long, she joined a local escort service called Cheetah's, but Powell was unhappy that 60 per cent of her intake had to go to the owner.\\n\\nSeeking a greater degree of financial independence, Powell launched a 'dance troupe' made up of unmarried friends 'who didn't mind strip-teasing' in clubs and at private bachelor parties.\\n\\n'Naturally, a girl could pick up extra cash by giving customers the satisfaction they sought after becoming thoroughly inflamed watching a half-dozen chocolate-skinned babes flaunting their goodies,' she says tellingly in her expose.\\n\\nPowell writes that the person who first introduced her to the idea of putting on shows at the University of Louisville was her friend Tink, who owned a local barber shop that was frequented by some of the college basketball players.\\n\\nIt was Tink, according to Powell, who put her in touch with Andre McGee about arranging adult entertainment for U of L recruits.\\n\\nMcGee had been a starting point guard for the Cardinals for four seasons and played for a year in Germany before coach head Rick Pitino hired him as an assistant whose job responsibilities included on campus recruiting efforts.\\n\\n'In Basketball programs,' Powell and Cady write,' highly touted potential recruits are wooed like young princes and treated like celebrities.\\n\\n'Victories, national glory and millions of dollars sometimes will hinge on the decisions, or perhaps whims, of adolescents still in high school.'\\n\\nPowell says in the book that in 2010, she and McGee, then 23 years old, settled on a price for an evening of entertainment - $300 not including tips - and she went to work rounding up her troupe, which\",\n",

And guess what,I found out what we were doing wrong! Just one little step messes up everything. Here is the steps from the TSB and only applies to the 2G.1. Park the vehicle so as it is level,front to back and side to side.2. IgOn and make sure that \"Trip A \" is showing on the odo ( this is where we made a mistake).3. Power down.4. Keep your foot off the brake.5. Push in and hold down the Odo/Trip button.6. Push the Power button twice to IgOn ( not Ready mode ).7. Turn the Odo/Trip off then On 3 times in 5 seconds.8. Continue holding the Odo/Trip button until a 6 digit code appears.9. Release,then push again the Odo/Trip button for another 5 seconds. The 6 digit code will change to a 5 digit code.10. After the middle digit,of the 5 digit code,changes to \"1\" release the Odo/Trip button and the odometer will return to normal reading.Hope this clarifies the steps.',\n",
       " 'Reader Theora notified us about something interesting recently. A transcript has been released of the original Raiders of the Lost Ark story conference among Lucas, Spielberg and Kasdan. Here\\'s a segment, which I\\'ve trimmed slightly for relevance to the kind of stuff we discuss here. G = George Lucas, S = Steven Spielberg, L = Lawrence Kasdan.\\n\\nFor a while, they weren\\'t sure what kind of girl to have as a counterpart to Indy…\\n\\nThere was talk about a big name professor who taught Indy everything he knew. Then there was the idea about this German girl, and for the sake of expediency, Kasdan suggested that Indy instead have an affair with the mentor\\'s daughter, which they loved. And then Lucas and Spielberg were off and running with ideas about how\\'s she\\'s been left in Peru and has this bar and is trying to get money together to get back to the States and loves (and resents) Indy to no end. In fact, Kasdan said he wanted Indy and this girl to already have a history when they meet because, \"I like it if they already had a relationship at one point. Because then you don\\'t have to build it.\" Hehehe…\\n\\nThen the discussion turned to how old Marion and Indy were at the time of the affair:\\n\\nG — I was thinking that this old guy could have been his mentor. He could have known this little girl when she was just a kid. Had an affair with her when she was eleven.\\n\\nL — And he was forty-two.\\n\\nG — He hasn\\'t seen her in twelve years. Now she\\'s twenty-two. It\\'s a real strange relationship.\\n\\nS — She had better be older than twenty-two.\\n\\nG — He\\'s thirty-five, and he knew her ten years ago when he was twenty-five and she was only twelve. It would be amusing to make her slightly young at the time.\\n\\nS — And promiscuous. She came onto him.\\n\\nG — Fifteen is right on the edge. I know it\\'s an outrageous idea, but it is interesting. Once she\\'s sixteen or seventeen it\\'s not interesting anymore. But if she was fifteen and he was twenty-five and they actually had an affair the last time they met. And she was madly in love with him and he…\\n\\nS — She has pictures of him.\\n\\nAnd now consider the dialog of that scene in the film.\\n\\nINDY: I never meant to hurt you.\\n\\nMARION: I was a child! I was in love.\\n\\nINDY: You knew what you were doing.\\n\\nMARION: It was wrong. You knew it.\\n\\nINDY: Look, I did what I did. I don\\'t expect you to be happy about it. But maybe we can do each other some good.\\n\\nMARION: Why start now?\\n\\nINDY: Shut up and listen for a second. I want that piece your father had. I\\'ve got money.\\n\\nMARION: How much?',\n",
       " 'I find this case to be kind of disturbing. Her accused rapist was investigated and it was found that there wasn\\'t enough evidence to support her accusation. Now, there are certainly some questions about the validity of that investigation, but the point is that it was investigated by the relevant authorities and a decision was made. This has become essentially a \"he said/she said\" situation.\\n\\n\\nDo you have to agree with the decision? No. Does another investigation need to be conducted? Maybe. However, I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to drag someone through the mud when they\\'ve been cleared of any charges.\\n\\n\\nThe focus should be on the university\\'s poor handling of the case, but instead this project has caused a lot of damage to a potentially innocent person. Rape is a serious issue and if the accused did rape her then he deserves to be punished, but there needs to be evidence that it happened.

       " 'Don\\'t waste your ad dollars with an over-the-top sales pitch. Well-written copy follows these simple guidelines.\\n\\nFebruary 16, 2009 14 min read\\n\\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\\n\\nThis article has been excerpted from Kick-Ass Copywriting in 10 Easy Steps by Susan Gunelius, available from Entrepreneur Press .\\n\\nWhether you\\'re a small-business owner, a medium-size business owner, an eBay seller, or simply trying to break into the copywriting industry, understanding the fundamentals of writing sales-oriented copy and put you on a path to success. At its core, copywriting is another device in a business\\' marketing toolbox. Well-written copy can make or break an ad or marketing piece. With that in mind, copywriting can equate to either well-spent advertising investments or a waste of advertising dollars.\\n\\nMany people misinterpret the uniqueness of effective copywriting. I can\\'t count the number of times I\\'ve heard freelance writers say they want to shift from article writing to copywriting as if it\\'s simply an extension of their existing abilities. Copywriting does come naturally to some people, but for most, it\\'s a foreign landscape they do not know how to navigate. Copywriting is about more than writing the hard sell sales letter that many short copywriting courses offer. In fact, I cringe when I see those over-the-top sales letters, which do little more than provide an ugly representation of copywriting, sales and marketing.\\n\\n\\nWell-crafted copywriting doesn\\'t need to beat a person over the head. It doesn\\'t have to drown in bold typeface and capitalization. The message should stand on its own without an overabundance of heavy-handed sales language and design embellishments. I associate many sales letters that are guilty of this technique with a writer who doesn\\'t truly understand the basic purpose of copywriting. However, successful copywriting can be achieved in 10 easy steps.\\n\\nConsider Your Copy Motivate your customer to buy with these 10 copywriting steps: 1. Exploit your product\\'s benefits\\n\\n\\n2. Exploit your competition\\'s weaknesses\\n\\n\\n3. Know your audience\\n\\n\\n4. Communicate W.I.I.F.M. (What\\'s In It For Me?)\\n\\n\\n5. Focus on \"you,\" not \"we\"\\n\\n\\n6. Understand your medium\\n\\n\\n7. Avoid T.M.I. (Too Much Information)\\n\\n\\n8. Include a call to action\\n\\n\\n9. C.Y.A. (Cover Your Ass)\\n\\n\\n10. Proofread\\n\\n1. Exploit your product\\'s benefits.\\n\\nThe first step of the copywriting outline is the foundation for your advertising campaigns. A benefit is the value of your product to a customer. In other words, a benefit is what the product can do for a customer or how the product can help a customer. You need to put into words the reasons your product is the best available and better than your competitors\\' products based on the added value it provides to your customers. The key to success is for you to fully understand all the benefits of your product. Only then can you ensure that the audience knows them and can relate to them.\\n\\n2. Exploit your competition\\'s weaknesses.\\n\\nTo write compelling copy, it is essential that you know what differentiates your product from the competition. Once you know your competitors\\' weaknesses, you must make sure your audience knows them and understands why buying your competitors\\' products would be a terrible mistake. Get started by thoroughly researching your competition and understanding what they offer in terms of products and services. Next, list the elements of their offerings that are inferior to your own. Feel free to tear the competition apart but be realistic in your comparisons. You want to be able to support your claims if you are challenged.\\n\\n3. Know your audience.\\n\\nEvery person in the world is not going to see every ad in the world. Each ad has a specific audience that will see it, and it\\'s the marketer\\'s job to find the best placement to ensure the target audience will see it. For example, an ad for skateboards placed in a local senior citizen housing association newsletter is not likely to generate a lot of sales. In fact, it would be a waste of advertising dollars. The target audience for skateboards is teenagers or young adults. The vast majority of senior citizens do not use skateboards, and it is not a product category in which they typically purchase gifts. Before you buy ad space, make sure you\\'re spending your money in the right place to get the biggest bang for your buck in terms of exposure and building awareness of your product or service.\\n\\nFirst, take the time to research your customers thoroughly. In most businesses, 20 percent of customers are responsible for 80 percent of sales (this is called the 80/20 rule in case you\\'re curious about the official marketing terminology for this phenomenon). That 20',\n",

       " 'With the Winter Olympics about a week away, you can see how Western magazine covers are graphically setting the mood — as well as the table for more fomentation. With the exception of the Reporters Without Borders imagery, as you can see, the Russian \"homosexual ban\" (and Putin\\'s sexuality) predominates. We can break down the lines of attack into three categories: Olympic ring modification; the mocking of Putin\\'s macho preoccupation with his own bod, the typology also setting homo-erotic bells ringing; and finally, Putin\\'s outright gay-ification.\\n\\nRainbow Hitler is particularly interesting for theorizing (without a word!) how Putin\\'s harshness toward homosexuality is a way to protect himself from his own broader spectrum of feelings — ones that are (also) otherwise right under his nose. The Le Monde fishing pole cover becomes a lot more interesting, by the way, once the anchor text brings power and dictatorship into the narrative. The translation: \"The dictatorship of the body.\" And then, Barry Blitt is on a real roll, isn\\'t he? In one sweep (double or triple twist?), he packages the homoerotic Putin with Putin in the closet. Might he also be Boitano-izing?\\n\\nI have to give special credit to the RWB image though. On one hand, it\\'s a slap shot to light up Putin and Russia on culture war issues. Leaving little to the imagination, the brass knuckles take bloody aim at the authoritarianism manifesting in Olympic-scale corruption and violent repression. That\\'s no game.\\n\\n(Note: The images above are new with the exception of Rainbow Hitler which was published from an Instagram image by New Civil Rights Movement in late August, and the Reporters Without Borders campaign, which is about a year old. photo-illustration 1: Reporters Without Borders Sochi 2014 Campaign. illustration 2: Paul Dotey/Xtra. photo 3: Dmitry Astakhov/EPA. photo 4: photo undetermined.
