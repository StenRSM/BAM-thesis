Officials did not release any evidence of the suspect having expressed support for the so-called sovereign citizen movement.\\n\\nRoof, 26, was charged with nine counts of murder for allegedly opening fire on the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine people. Police believe he targeted the church because of its predominantly black congregants.\\n\\nThe suspect\\'s older brother, Daniel, told a news conference: \"He doesn\\'t hate anybody. He has nothing against any race.\" He also said that Roof was \"stupid\" for getting involved in the shooting.\\n\\nRoof wrote a chilling Facebook post in which he said he wanted to start a race war by executing black people. \"I have to do it,\" he posted on Sunday. \"I want to start something big…I don\\'t have a choice.\"\\n\\n\\nAccording to police, the suspect is a white man with white supremacist and anti-government tattoos, such as the flag of the sovereign citizens movement.\\n\\n\\nRoof said he had made a choice, a few months ago, to become the person he wanted to be, police spokesperson Chief Greg Mullen said. He described the suspect as a \"monster\".\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the family of one of the victims, Rev Clementa Pinckney, expressed \"heartfelt gratitude\" to the community for their support.\\n\\nThe Rev Pinckney, was remembered on Wednesday night as an inspiring Christian minister whose life was taken.\\n\\nThe city\\'s mayor, Joseph Riley, called him \"the most beloved man in Charleston\".\\n\\nCharleston shootings: \\'That\\'s not the America I know\\' Read more\\n\\nThe FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for people who will call them with information about the shooting. They are also looking at the suspect\\'s social media, the Charleston police department said.\\n\\nCharleston attorney James Brindle, who represents the victims\\' families, said: \"We continue to pray for all those affected by this terrible tragedy. We ask that the media respect those grieving families who want their privacy respected during this trying time. We ask that these hateful crimes be taken away from their families who may need time to grieve.\"\\n\\nA Facebook post on the website of the Sovereign Citizens of America\\'s local website, South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, also referred to the suspect as Dylann Storm Roof.\\n\\nIt is a group that is not recognised by the Federal government but is described as \"a broad association of citizens who support and respect the Constitution of the United States and its governing document, the Declaration of Independence\".'"
